With fans having no prior knowledge of the actor being in poor health, the announcement came as a huge surprise and caused a tremendous amount of public confusion. Why did Chadwick Boseman keep this information close and only inform a few chosen people?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chadwick-boseman-passed-away-from-colon-cancer-in-2020>Chadwick Boseman Passed Away From Colon Cancer In 2020</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chadwick-Boseman-in-Black-Panther.jpg><p>Boseman entertained many for a significant portion of his life, having his first role early on in the soap opera All My Children. Prior to his acting career, Boseman had an eye for the entertainment industry when he attended Howard University.</p><p>It was there he received a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts, with a focus on directing. The <a href=#>star at the center of the iconic Marvel movie Black Panther</a> suddenly passed away on August 28, 2020, at the age of 43.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How The Stars Of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Honored Chadwick Boseman</a></span></p><p>Born in Anderson, South Carolina on November 29, 1976, Boseman left behind his wife, Taylor Simone Ledward Boseman, his parents, and two brothers.

Additionally, he insisted that African dance was inserted into the waterfall scene.</p><p>While this caused some conflict at the time between the others on the set, Boseman only wanted to fulfill roles that brought light to the world and highlighted a culture that was often underrepresented.</p><p>Chadwick Boseman continued to work while undergoing chemotherapy and treatments for his disease. He often traveled with an entourage of people who were there to help him if he needed it, which was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">something his co-stars didn't understand at the time</a>.</p><h2 id=chadwick-refused-to-tell-people-he-was-dying-of-cancer-for-four-years>Chadwick Refused To Tell People He Was Dying Of Cancer For Four Years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chadwick-boseman-in-2019.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans noticed that the <a href=#>star was reaching an unhealthy weight</a> in the months leading up to his death.

In fact, he walked away from his first job on All My Children when they changed the script to reflect activities that Boseman didn't want to participate in as he felt they didn't offer much in the way of the person he wanted to portray.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, once the diagnosis was received it appears that Boseman purposely kicked this up a notch to create a strong legacy while he could. Knowing he had a finite period of time left, he wanted to do everything he could to leave his mark on the world in all the right ways. With that, he decided not to reveal his health status in order to keep the focus on his work and not his personal life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecKhmJ2vmZi4bq7OrJymmZ5itaqwxGaamqaTmr9usMianqeno57AcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tiffany-smiley-husband-scott-smiley-was-blinded.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tiffany Smiley Husband Scott Smiley Was Blinded In Iran  Age Bio And Children">&larr;
