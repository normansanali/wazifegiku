Since then, he has released his debut song 'Flame' that is doing well on radio stations and streaming online across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>After his recent win, MEA WorldWide (MEAWW) caught up with Hardy and asked him about his initial days starting off in the season. Apparently, Hardy had no idea of&nbsp;auditioning again when he accompanied his friend to the show.&nbsp;</p><p>"I had no idea because she called me up before the audition was scheduled and we started practicing a bit and throughout I kept telling her that in no chance or circumstance will I audition and I'm not doing it again. I went in and I was just focused on not messing up playing the guitar for her because she said she was getting a little nervous."</p><p>He continued, "I went in there and the judges didn't know I was there and it was a surprise for them too. She sang and she got the golden ticket and we were telling the judges bye and I was trying to get out of there. Then the judges started talking to me, we were all just talking and stuff. Then Katy asked me to sing a song, and I was like 'yeah, I'll sing a song'. I didn't think in any possible way that there was a chance that I could go again and do it another time. But, I backed up to the teamwork and started singing and then I took the ticket."</p><p>When asked if Hardy was surprised that the judges remembered him, he replied in the affirmative: "I was surprised. I remembered them, but yeah I was surprised they remembered me and it's pretty cool."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/5038e330-6ab3-4902-8055-292283edc507.jpg><p>Talking about his friend Ashton who he accompanied for the audition, Hardy revealed, "She's playing around. She's still playing music, singing, and everything. Sadly she didn't make it past the first round of Hollywood Week but later that day we talked and she was happy where she was because she got all that experience. She was fine with it and she's playing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomZ2av6qvwKdkopyfoXqtrcinnGagkaexunnFoqWapJVixKq6zZ6pZp6clrqmec2ermarmaO0rbGMrKann12Wuaa2wKebq6ddlr%2BiusOa</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./skincare-beauty-products-cult-favorite-hair.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Beauty Products With Cult Followings You May Not Have Heard Of">&larr;
