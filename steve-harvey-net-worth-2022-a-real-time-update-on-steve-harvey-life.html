Harvey, on the other hand, has achieved considerable success in a variety of other enterprises in addition to his comic career.</p><p>Harvey is well-known as a dynamic and engaging host, perhaps even more so than he is as a stand-up comic.

Despite his error, in which he wrongly declared the first-runner-up as the winner and had to admit a few minutes after she was crowned that he had read the results incorrectly, he has gone on to host the Miss Universe pageant in 2016, 2017, and 2018 despite the controversy surrounding it.</p><h2><strong>Steve Harvey Personal life</strong></h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Steve Harvey (@iamsteveharveytv)</a></p><p><strong>Harvey has been married three times throughout his life.</strong> His current wife, Marjorie Bridges, whom he married in 2007, is the mother of his children. Marjorie’s children, whom he adopted when the couple married, give him a total of seven children: three from his first marriage, one from his second marriage, and Marjorie’s three children from her first marriage. As a result of his partnership with Marjorie, he established The Steve and Marjorie Harvey Foundation, which is dedicated to youth outreach and education.</p><h2><strong>Steve Harvey House & Properties</strong></h2><p>In February 2018, Steve and Marjorie leased a large mansion in Beverly Park, a gated community atop Beverly Hills, California. The 12,000-square-foot house on just under 2 acres was once listed for lease at $125,000 PER MONTH, but the Harveys were able to talk the owners down to $110,000 per month. That works out to about $1.3 million in rent per year. The house was listed for sale for $23.5 million at one point in 2007.</p><p>Outside of Los Angeles, Steve Harvey owns a 9,000-square-foot mansion in Atlanta that he purchased in 2010 for $3.4 million, as well as a 4-acre mansion outside of Dallas, Texas. Steve bought a 5,500-square-foot house on the 88th floor of Trump International in Chicago in 2013. In 2018, he sold that property for $7.7 million.</p><p></p><p>In May 2020, Steve paid $15 million for Tyler Perry’s former Atlanta mansion. The 35,000-square-foot gated estate sits on 17 acres. Tyler purchased the house in 2017, spent millions on renovations, and sold it to an evangelist named David Turner for $17.5 million in 2016. Turner lost $2.5 million on the property.</p><h2 id=summary><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p><strong>Steve Harvey has an estimated net worth of $200 million.</strong> Among his many media empires are radio, television, apparel, novels, and other forms of entertainment. A normal year for him brings in $45 million from his multiple professions, including $10 million from hosting Family Feud, which he does for a living.</p><h2>Fans of “Family Feud” are left speechless by Steve Harvey’s wife Majorie sexy backless outfit.</h2><p>The other members of Steve Harvey’s marriage also have excellent fashion sense.</p><p>Marjorie, the wife of the Family Feud presenter, is always dressed to the nines, as was evident when the couple stepped out together last month while on vacation in Paris. Marjorie rocked the show in some of her most recognizable outfits, including a daring blazer dress, a white scarf top ensemble, and a timeless little black dress. But she also wore an all-black attire, which may have slipped Family Feud fans’ notice.</p><p>Marjorie shared a series of images on Instagram on July 5 in which she was seen sporting what appeared to be leather trousers and a halter top. The top was backless and featured a keyhole pattern with gold hardware accents.</p><p>Marjorie noted in the photographs that she finished the appearance with a black clutch purse and stiletto shoes. She also wore her hair in a straight ponytail and accessorized with understated gold. Steve didn’t take long to express his opinion to her after seeing her amazing dress. He left a “❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️” remark on his wife’s Instagram post.</p><p>Family Feud followers also stopped by Marjorie’s Instagram comments section without missing a beat. Unbelievable, a commenter wrote. “🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 You look fantastic,” a second person chimed in. “Mrs. Harvey, you are incredibly gorgeous! Just stunning! “,” a different supporter chimed in.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Marjorie Harvey (@marjorie_harvey)</a></p><p>The costume isn’t seen in any Instagram or TikTok videos, but Marjorie undoubtedly shone on the Parisian streets. Steve has previously discussed how she altered his sense of style. He said to E! News in an interview that Marjorie engaged his stylist Elly Karamoh to upgrade his wardrobe.</p><p>“Steve, look, you’ve been on TV, you have a brand, and you’ve safeguarded it for so long,” she continued. People never see how you dress when you’re not on TV,” “He told the publication. “I want you to begin dressing as you do offstage, but I’m going to get you some help because you don’t have time to go shopping.”</p><p>Steve finally thought that the solution was simple. What was I going to say to her if I said “No”?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX6jBpsLEZp%2Baqqaaxm66xK1ksKeiqbVufo9raWaZXaeyoriMraCmnV2qvaWt055kqKZdqMGmwsRmn5qqpprGbrjIn5xoa2NqhnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./twiztidswe-dont-die-lyrics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TwiztidsWe Dont Die Lyrics">&larr;
