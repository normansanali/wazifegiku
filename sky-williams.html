Source: TwitterBefore fame</p><h2><span id=Before_Fame>Before Fame</span></h2><p>Sky Williams was a very athletic child throughout his early school life. He was a very bright student, as he got encouragement from his school to take part in the Gifted and Talented Education program. He began struggling with depression in the sixth grade, which further increased with his fellow students, many of whom actively bullied him. The time he figured out that he was homosexual and in trying to keep from shaming his family, made a promise to keep it a secret, forever. He found it in playing video games, most notably the video game Super Smash Brothers.</p><p>His interest in games led to his fascination with competitive online video gaming and his struggle to be the best at the game. He began participating in gaming tournaments, every weekend. Throughout this time he even got involved in improvised humor, as a hobby, which ultimately became part of his career. He finds his first comedy through a talent show victory in his high school. At that point, he concluded that he would grow up to become a comedian.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Willams is a YouTube gamer, stand-up comedian, and vlogger. After he started playing ‘Super Smash Brothers’, he was so hooked on the game that he ended up participating in competitive gaming. To become the top performer, Williams started to attend gaming tournaments every weekend.</p><p>After the alleged suicide of actor Robin Williams, he posted a video titled A Message to the Depressed on his YouTube channel ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sky Williams</a>‘ addressing depression. It was posted on August 12, 2014. This video went viral and reached a far greater audience than his gamer subscribers.</p><p>Some of his famous videos on YouTube include “5 Reasons Why I Hate ADCs/Marksman Mains.,” “6 Reasons Why I Hate Draft Mode.,” “4 Reasons Why You’re Stuck in ‘Elo Hell’.” and “5 Reasons Why Your Jungler Hates You.”</p><p>Currently, his YouTube channel has garnered more than 825K subscribers with almost 196 million total views.</p><h4><span>Journey as a Comedian</span></h4><p>Though he is a prominent gamer, he had his first taste of fame as a comedian. Through his school years, he became so good at improvised humor, that he participated in a school talent show and won the trophy for performing original jokes.</p><p>He worked for six years as a server at Applebees, where he learned about the Flappers comedy competition by chance one day. Sky has performed as a stand-up comedian and even won a Comedy Contest at Flappers Comedy Club.</p><p>Williams was inspired to become a comedian by watching standup comedy on Comedy Central. He would often make random jokes and see what makes people laugh, only to note it down and try it to a different audience. He also reacts to Reddit memes.</p><p>After winning a talent show at school, he went to his mother to tell her that he aims to become a comedian. However, he didn’t get the support he had expected from his family and ended up moving out to live on his own after a heated conversation with his stepfather. He eventually proved himself right by achieving success as a comedian and a gamer. Moreover, the popular personality doesn’t seem to be involved in brand endorsement activities. However, he will surely be working as a brand ambassador for top brands in the coming days.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-14835 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sky-Williams-comedy.jpg alt="Sky Williams- comedy" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-14835 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Sky Williams performing in Flappers Comedy Contest.

Noticing that he is losing popularity, even his friends started to ditch him, which made his depression worse.</p><p>However, as he sought refuge in his gaming community, he realized that his co-gamers didn’t care whether he was a loser or a gay, and rather shared the same passion for the game. However, feeling lonely at home and school, he started to socialize with his gamer friends by trying to make them laugh.</p><p>Furthermore, Williams faced online criticism recently after he pointed out cyber bullies.
