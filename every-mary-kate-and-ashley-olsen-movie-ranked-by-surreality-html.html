Which is why I’m here to remind you that, for a very long time, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were famous for being straight-to-VHS movie stars.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13ly06001h3a66wrkgbbtd@published data-word-count=157>Mary-Kate and Ashley do not want me to remind you about this. In fact, they’ve spent the duration of their adult lives painstakingly detaching themselves from this legacy. They speak <a href=#>to only one or two publications a year</a>, exclusively about The Row and how fundamentally horrifying it is when anyone asks them anything that’s not about The Row. They skulk around New York City in massive sunglasses, hiding behind sheets of dripping-wet hair. They force guests to forfeit cell phones at their intimate weddings to old French men, where they <a href=#>pass around “bowls and bowls” of cigarettes</a>. As a rebuke to being paid to smile with teeth for decades, they now never <a href=#>— never —</a> smile with teeth. I both admire and fear the effort. However, I also believe it would be a failure of cultural morality on par with the plot of The Giver if we were to willingly forget about the twins’ archival film work.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13lxzs001g3a66u5wrp3rd@published data-word-count=147>So let’s dive in. From 1992 to 2004, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen starred in a total of 36 movies. Each of these 36 films is located on a sliding scale of uncanny, ranging from casually surreal to utterly phantasmagorical. They do share some consistencies: In each, they play twin sisters engaged in some kind of caper. Sometimes they play themselves; sometimes they play avatars named “Mary-Kate” and “Ashley” who do not share the real Mary-Kate and Ashley’s overwhelming international fame, a sort of tragic meditation on what their lives might have been. More often than not, they play “regular girls” named things like “Chloe” and “Riley” and “Maddie” and “Roxy.” They switch places with regularity. They are often kidnapped. Their parents are usually unmentioned — or appear only in voiceover, divorced, widowed, or dead. Their eyes always betray a profound sadness known only to overworked child stars.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13ly17001k3a66wmz2fbc9@published data-word-count=152>Much of the twins’ early work, released on fat VHS tapes or made for TV, comprised 30-minute serial romps that fell into one of two categories: <a href=#>“The Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley”</a> (a compelling youth-detective series) or the<a href=#> “You’re Invited” </a>series (composed of various bougie parties thrown by the twins to celebrate totally random life events). In these shorter films, one of the twins takes the role of the “sporty tomboy who likes horses” (usually Mary-Kate) and one takes the role of the “priss who likes homework” (usually Ashley). They wear complementary but never matching outfits, and at some point clash over a benign issue, like whether they should ride horses or do homework, only to come together at the end of it all and reaffirm their supernatural bond. Most of these films feature original song-and-dance routines that transcend the constraints set by their respective plots. There are, occasionally, accompanying albums, too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13ly0y001i3a66qadquwcz@published data-word-count=108>The twins eventually graduated to standalone, 90-minute “features,” frequently filmed in an exotic locale with two perfunctory love interests who the twins kiss exactly once, at least one rude older person or corporation standing in the way of those love interests, stunning character names plucked from Francine Pascal’s discard pile, and a consistently deranged B-plot meant to convey some larger life lesson. In these longer movies, the twins evolve from “horse girl” and “homework girl” to “free spirit” and “responsible neurotic” — one has curly hair, one has straight hair, etc. Only two of these full-length features ever played in theaters: It Takes Two and New York Minute.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13ly11001j3a669cl1agy2@published data-word-count=134>Because the Olsens are nothing if not thorough, many of these films are now rather difficult to watch without spending significant amounts of cash. If you search Amazon, for example, you’ll see a majority of them listed, but described as<a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link> “currently unavailable.”</a> At the beginning of May, Hulu added only three Olsen twin films to its streaming offerings — Billboard Dad, Passport to Paris, and Switching Goals — and it was <a href=#>hailed as a coup. </a>Most of the twins features are available for purchase-only at a hefty $15 on iTunes. Some of the earlier VHS tapes are ripped and <a href=#>chopped and screwed on YouTube,</a> and some are available on the dark web, probably. But it would seem the Olsens’s Lynchian masterpieces are being slowly erased by time and, I’m guessing, a lot of lawyers.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13ly1d001m3a66r5t9bv97@published data-word-count=189>As a child who grew up so profoundly obsessed with the Olsen twins that my primary mode of punishment was “we’re taking away your Olsen twins videos,” I feel it’s my patriotic duty to revisit the Olsens’ catalogue and burn it permanently into our cultural hive mind. The Olsens once (actually, many times) asked us: “<a href=#>Who stole the great Hope Diamond? What killed the dinosaurs? Who makes the finest pizza? What’s in your brother’s dresser drawers?”</a> I want to honor those staggering, time-worn questions with my own: “Which Olsen twin movies test the sheer bounds of reality as we recognize it, and which merely play gently with the notions of time and space?” So I ventured deep into the internet and the annals of my brain to provide you with this surreality ranking. I’d like to think of it as a love letter to the Olsen twins, who taught me that you do not need a work permit to solve crimes at the age of 9, but that you can name yourself “Maddie” and “Riley” over and over again in various movies and nobody will do much about it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13ly19001l3a66z4hcihy6@published data-word-count=83>A brief note on criteria: I’m only including films that the twins starred in together. I’m ignoring their TV work (I’m so sorry, Two Of A Kind), any minor cameos (my apologies, Charlie’s Angels), and the few projects they did separately as adults (RIP, pot-smoking <a href=#>Mary-Kate in The Wackness</a> and Ashley popping up in that random<a href=#> 30 Seconds to Mars video</a>). In several cases, the film in question was unavailable, so I relied entirely on Wikipedia and my unimpeachable childhood memory of it.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjw14eg2b01js3a66eyphcwzl@published>36. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Winning London" href=#>Winning London</a> (2001)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13o26t00283a667l23q2tu@published data-word-count=6><strong>The names: </strong>Chloe and Riley Lawrence</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13o26u00293a66n5tax0nh@published data-word-count=120><strong>The plot:</strong> Winning London, one of the Olsens’ first “features,” is objectively not bad. It follows a relatively cohesive structure, though it flips the script, casting Mary-Kate as the “responsible neurotic” and Ashley as the “ditz with a crush,” which makes it ever-so-slightly surreal for someone who’s been following them since youth. The girls head to London to compete in an international Model-UN competition, and are devastated to realize that the country they usually represent, China, is already representing itself at the competition. Just like it goes down in the real UN! Meanwhile, Mary-Kate falls for a British nobleman’s son, Ashley falls in love with her mom’s best friend’s son, they all kiss (separately), and some adults make out, too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13o26v002a3a666hcjefx6@published data-word-count=24><strong>The lesson:</strong> I’ll let Wikipedia take this one: “Tribulations are weathered and lessons learned about sportsmanship, overlooked friends, and learning to enjoy one’s youth.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13o26v002b3a66zpgizwxb@published data-word-count=7><strong>The most surreal moment: </strong>This girl’s hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/659/ca2/1eb6da9bf39f19376c9b6fb7e41cc7d9ca-07-olsen-twin-lede.rsquare.w400.jpg> <span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjw14ff0g01mb3a66paalhqnf@published>35. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Switching Goals" href=#>Switching Goals</a> (1999)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13sdj5008v3a667hdjux4e@published data-word-count=6><strong>The names:</strong> Sam and Emma Stanwell</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw141vhy00sg3a6619r3t4uw@published data-word-count=128><strong>The plot: </strong>“They’re twin sisters, but they couldn’t be more different!” intones the man who narrates all of Mary-Kate and Ashley’s trailers.<strong> </strong>Mary-Kate’s Sam is a soccer star who wants boys to crush on her; Ashley’s Emma is a girly crush object who wants to be better at soccer. Both do play soccer, though, to be clear. Their dad, a boy, is a soccer coach obsessed with winning at sports. Please draw this as a Venn Diagram, then come back. Profound intrigue unfolds when the girls are put on the “wrong” soccer teams and decide to switch places, then get caught. Ultimately Emma realizes her true talent is as a goalie, both find tween lust, their dad learns to chill the fuck out, and<a href=#> Michael Cera shows up.</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw141yli00t13a66bvm3buag@published data-word-count=12><strong>The lesson: </strong>Everyone is good at soccer in their own special way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw1421bd00tm3a66f1idmg9o@published data-word-count=40><strong>The most surreal moment: </strong>Soccer player Alexi Lalas, name-dropped twice in the movie, shows up out of literal nowhere training youths in a field. <a href=#>“He’s cute</a>!” says one of the girls. “Think he could play for us?”&nbsp;This is never explained.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjw14hh8x01ou3a66kzdn1x21@published>34. <a data-vars-anchor-text="The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley: The Case of Thorn Mansion" href=#>The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley: The Case of Thorn Mansion</a> (1994)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13t7us009h3a66mg4j35x5@published data-word-count=16><strong>The names: </strong>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, owners and purveyors of the Olsen and Olsen Mystery Agency</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13t7ut009i3a66cs08wsy0@published data-word-count=71><strong>The plot: </strong>This is the first in a long series of Olsen and Olsen Mystery Agency videos, wherein actual adults call the Olsens to help them solve crimes.

The films each have two intro setpieces: One is based on the works of Edgar Allen Poe, again for no apparent reason, and the other features the twins sporting garish overalls and singing about things “getting crazy.” In this entry in the series, Ashley is a tight-ass who can’t stop checking the Sleepover Party list; Mary-Kate is a free spirit who likes to stand on her head. Their friends come over and listen to “fresh CDs,” order pizza, do the Running Man, and antagonize the brother they nearly sold off to human traffickers (see “Our First Video”).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13v5ie00b23a66gjb47eaz@published data-word-count=5><strong>The lesson: </strong>Honestly, not sure.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw13v5ie00b33a664kncqtlx@published data-word-count=71><strong>The most surreal moment: </strong>This particular film gave birth to the infamous<a href=#> “Gimme Pizza” song,</a> which is so deeply surreal and discomfiting that it enters the black hole of the uncanny and reemerges as completely normal and reasonable.

Ashley is Alyssa, a prim rich girl with several tiny pantsuits and a daddy complex who hates her widowed father’s (Steve Gutenberg) new fiancé. Mary-Kate’s tomboyish Amanda is an orphan — we hit both tropes here! — who lives in Manhattan, chews multiple pieces of gum simultaneously, and is dying to be adopted by her orphanage … coordinator? (Kirstie Alley). The girls run into each other in the woods while Amanda is visiting Alyssa’s dad’s charity summer camp, realize they’re identical strangers (this is never explained on any level, nor questioned), switch places, set up their respective adult guardians, and meditate on the nature of cellular communication in the 21st century.

But this is never addressed. Are the Hunter twins actually estranged Hunter quadruplets, each having their own adventures on opposite sides of the world? Or does When in Rome represent a split in the space-time continuum, a separate strand of the multiverse wherein Taylor and Kylie never received their own Mustang, changed their names, and fled to Rome?</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjw15gywc04f83a66mz2byd9r@published>2. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Double, Double, Toil and Trouble" href=#>Double, Double, Toil and Trouble</a> (1993)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw15hyms04hl3a663x8vf6ix@published data-word-count=6><strong>The names:</strong> Kelly and Lynn Farmer</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw15ic7a04ir3a661klvx6ux@published data-word-count=114><strong>The plot:</strong> The Olsens’ second made-for-TV movie, Double, Double, Toil and Trouble, laid waste to the Oxford comma and co-starred Cloris Leachman as the twins’ “cold and cruel” Great Aunt Agatha.<strong> </strong>Twin sisters Kelly and Lynn Farmer are on a mission to help their parents escape from crushing debt, so they ask Aunt Agatha, who has a big-ass mansion, for a loan. Being cold and cruel, she refuses. Aunt Agatha’s personal grave digger (!) informs Kelly and Lynn that Agatha actually has her own twin, Sophia, who’s trapped inside a mirror in the mansion because of an ancient witch’s moonstone, now possessed by Agatha. The twins set out to <a href=#>rescue Sophia from the mirror.</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw15imc104jw3a66jwins3d8@published data-word-count=50><strong>The lesson:</strong> Do not use moonstones recklessly. In the beginning of the movie, the twins are “tired of being identical” and want to use the moonstone to stop being identical. (Please note that in real life, the Olsen twins are fraternal.) By the end, they want to be identical again.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw15iy5k04l13a66bqnnclyv@published data-word-count=195><strong>The most surreal moment: </strong>Honestly, this is hard. Is it when several people become turtles? Is it the end of the film, when Aunt Agatha, now trapped in several shards of the mirror, yells at the twins, “I hate Halloween!”? Or is it this part, helpfully summarized by Wikipedia: “The first person they meet is a homeless man who dreams of money and stardom, Mr. N (Meshach Taylor), who offers to help the girls because they shouldn’t be on such a dangerous journey without an adult. The girls carry with them a toy magic wand that they won at a Halloween party days before, which actually has unexplained genuine magical powers. Kelly, Lynn, and Mr. N visit a phony psychic to ask where they are able to find the witches’ gathering that Aunt Agatha will attend that night, but Lulu is unable to answer, so instead, they use the wand to find the location and set off again by secretly hitching a ride on a pumpkin truck. They get dropped off near a woodland and find a small house deep inside, the home of a man named Oscar (Phil Fondacaro) who wishes to be taller.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjw15jxk304nc3a66kownqv6s@published>1.<a data-vars-anchor-text="New York Minute" href=#>New York Minute</a> (2004)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw15l77904ps3a66m5q3bve7@published data-word-count=6><strong>The names:</strong> Jane and Roxy Ryan</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw15lm6104qz3a66drt4rnem@published data-word-count=235><strong>The plot: </strong>New York Minute is the last film ever to feature both Olsen twins, and the last release by Dualstar, the twins’ privately owned production brand<strong>.</strong> Released in theaters just before the twins turned 18 and evaporated into thin air, it hits every Olsen trope: 1) Jane, played by Ashley, is — wait for it — neurotic with glasses and straight hair, and Roxy, played by Mary-Kate, is deranged with curls. Jane uses toilet-seat liners on her personal toilet and wants to go to Oxford; Roxy skips school to go to a metal show and wants to be … a rock star. (Imagine if their parents’ had named them in the opposite order — chaos.) They are not friends. 2) Their father, played by Dr. Drew for literally no reason, is widowed. The film follows Roxy and Jane as the former tries to get her demo to a famous Blink 182-esque band, and as the latter tries to give a speech to win a college fellowship. 3) Both encounter a series of increasingly insane roadblocks as they attempt to achieve their goals, including 4) becoming incidentally embroiled in an international scandal. 5) They are abducted, briefly, twice. 6) At the end, after an identity swap, they 7) realize they love each other even though one wears a red beret and the other wears a pink suit, and both 8) make out with a boy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw22jzau008j3h66s0j3gyvo@published data-word-count=19><strong>The lesson: </strong>You can make the same movie 36 times and still make $14 million in U.S. box office.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjw15lm6204r03a667fagcg03@published data-word-count=170><strong>The most surreal moment: </strong>This film is gorgeously demented. Where to begin? Roxy wears flip-flops around Manhattan on purpose. New York City is depicted as a kaleidoscope of horrors, full of criminals and filthy alcoholics, but also so small that it’s possible to accidentally run into the same eight people all day long. Jane scolds Roxy for helping a homeless man. Instances of casual racism include the twins <a href=#>entering a black hair salon and saying, “We’re not in Kansas anymore,”</a> and a white villain putting on a stereotypical Asian accent for the duration of the film. An entire scene centers on the comedy of having to use a bodega bathroom, and ends with Jane falling down the toilet. Later the girls end up inside a sewer. Eugene Levy is a truancy officer whose entire life is based around stalking and exposing Roxy. The Osbournes have supporting roles. A key plot point revolves around a dog taking a shit. Most upsettingly, they spend an inordinate amount of time in Times Square.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Every Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen Movie, Ranked by Surreality</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocmdganymwsSrsGalkafGbrfArZxmmZ6ZeqK%2Fx6WcsmWfocCmuoympq%2BhlWK%2ForrKnptmmqliwLa%2B0Z6YpaGkrnupwMyl</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-lawrence.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How many kids does Jennifer Lawrence have, Pregnancy, Eye Surgery, Net Worth, Age, Baby Name, Weddin">&larr;
