They fell in love fast and they fell hard for each other, and as a result, they’re the most adorable couple.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>They’re very open about their relationship and aren’t afraid to share all of the adorable selfies and their cutest moments together with the entire world.

Sarah made it no secret that she had a crush on her future fiance, tweeting: "Ugh! @WellsAdams making a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Lord of the Flies</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> reference on men tell all??? #knewhewasthebestfromthestart #menwhoreadarehot.”</span></p><h2 id=they-flirted-on-social-media><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>They Flirted On Social Media</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2017, things started to heat up on social media between the two</a> when Sarah tweeted her excitement to see Wells on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Bachelor in Paradise</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> as the bartender. She tweeted: “OH MY GOD @WellsAdams IS THE FRIKKIN BARTENDER?! Best. Season. Ever. #BachelorInParadise.”</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>She finally got his attention (and his reply) when he tweeted back “Taking applications for #BIP5 bar backs now. Please send references..Preferably from Phil Dunphy. I’m kidding the job is yours @Sarah_Hyland.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In which Sarah responded: “I’ll start working on my garnishing skills. Oh and I require 35% of your tips… or free dogs.” That was only the beginning of their flirting.</span></p><h2 id=he-slid-into-her-dms><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>He Slid Into Her DMs</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>After the flirting back and forth on Twitter, Wells decided to take a step further and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">slide into Sarah’s DMs on Twitter.</a> Sarah recently revealed that what he messaged her was sweet, simple, and to the point which made her like him that much more. He said: “Next time I’m in LA, I’m taking you out for drinks and tacos.”</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-by-her-side-during-her-kidney-transplants><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>He Was By Her Side During Her Kidney Transplants</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In September 2017, Sarah had to have a second kidney transplant. It was also around the same time that Sarah met Wells in person. Three days before her surgery, the two met, and they were both smitten from the start. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wells stood by Sarah’s side before, during, and after her transplant</a>, despite the fact that they weren’t officially dating yet, and barely knew each other.</span></p><h2 id=rumors-began-swirling-when-they-posted-a-couples-costume-on-halloween><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Rumors Began Swirling When They Posted A Couples Costume On Halloween</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>About a month later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two started to spark rumors that something was truly going on </a>between them. Sarah posted a picture of them in their Halloween costume to her Instagram. They went as a couples costume, Sarah dressing as Dustin and Wells dressing as Eleven from the hit Netflix show, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Stranger Things</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h2 id=it-was-reported-they-were-dating-in-november-of-2017><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>It Was Reported They Were Dating In November Of 2017</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>After that Halloween photo, and posting a few flirty photos in between, the rumor mill really started swirling. In November of 2017, most, if not all of the world’s tabloids started to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">report that the two of them were officially dating</a>. And for once, despite speculation, they were right about Wells and Sarah.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did You Know These 15 Stars Dated People From Bachelor Nation?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-spent-major-holidays-together><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>They Spent Major Holidays Together</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Despite the fact that they had only been together for a few months, they took another huge step together, spending major holidays together. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">For Christmas, Sarah and Wells spent it together with Wells’ family</a>, the two of them sharing the cutest selfies and pictures on social media to share with the world.</span></p><h2 id=he-was-by-her-side-during-her-kidney-scare><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Was By Her Side During Her Kidney Scare</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2018, Sarah had another health scare</a> related to her kidney issues, which led her to go to the hospital. Although Wells was away for work, he made sure that he was still there for Sarah by any means possible, and tried to make it back home to her as fast as he could.</span></p><h2 id=they-did-long-distance-for-a-while><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Did Long Distance For A While</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately for the couple, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they were forced to&nbsp;do long-distance for a little while</a> during their relationship. Of course, Sarah lived in LA since she was taping episodes of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Modern Family</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, however, Wells lived in Nashville at the time. They made it work, though, as Wells flew to see her almost every weekend.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Pics Showing How Much Sarah Hyland Has Changed Since Season 1 Of Modern Family</a></span></p><h2 id=they-moved-in-together-summer-2018><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Moved In Together Summer&nbsp;2018</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>During the summer of 2018, Wells and Sarah took another big step in their relationship, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two moved in together just shy of a year of dating.</a> Rumors swirled when a moving truck was spotted in front of Sarah’s house in Los Angeles. The rumors were true, as the two have been living together since.</span></p><h2 id=they-re-super-cute-on-social-media><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They're Super Cute On Social Media</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Love them or hate them, there’s no denying that Wells and Sarah and definitely one of the cutest couples in Hollywood. On social media they can be rather adorable, posting selfies and cute photos of one another. They’re extra sappy when they celebrate holidays and milestones, and we can’t help but love them!</span></p><h2 id=wells-asked-julie-bowen-for-permission-to-marry-sarah><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Wells&nbsp;Asked Julie Bowen For Permission To Marry Sarah</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since 2009, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julie Bowen has played Sarah’s mom, Claire Dunphy</a> on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Modern Family</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. As a result, she’s been a second mother to Sarah over the years. Before Wells proposed to Sarah, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he decided that he should also ask Sarah’s TV mom.</a> Julie was thrilled and really liked Wells from the beginning, and was more than happy to give them her blessing.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Modern Family's Haley Dunphy: 16 Things To Know About Sarah Hyland</a></span></p><h2 id=their-parents-haven-t-met><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Their Parents Haven't Met</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>It may come as a surprise, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wells’ parents and Sarah’s parents still haven’t met</a> yet, and they probably won’t actually meet until the two get married. Why is that? They both fall on completely opposite sides of the political spectrum. Sarah’s family is very liberal while Wells’ family are extremely conservative, so they’re dreading the meeting between them.</span></p><h2 id=they-got-engaged-in-july-2019><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Got Engaged In July 2019</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 16, 2019, Wells finally popped the question.</a> He and Sarah were on a super romantic in Fiji, and when they were enjoying some time on the beach, he got down on one knee and asked her the big question, and of course, she said yes!
