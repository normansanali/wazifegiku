Let's take a closer look at her monster salary and see how she made her millions.</p><h2 id=judge-judy-is-an-iconic-televison-star>Judge Judy Is An Iconic Televison Star</h2><p>Unless a person has been living under a rock for the last 25 years, then they are no doubt aware of who Judge Judy is. Daytime television might not be for everyone, but many hosts have found huge audiences through the years. Judge Judy just so happens to be one of the most famous of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The acclaimed figure spent years cutting her teeth as a lawyer before getting the chance to be a criminal court judge. She would steadily work her way up the ladder while also earning a reputation for the way that she handled things.

Despite this, she shows no signs of slowing down, and she has plans to keep things going.</p><p>"I’m not tired. I don’t play golf or tennis. I have no desire to learn how to play mahjong, chess or checkers. I know what I like to do. Why, at my stage in life, would I try to find something else when I already know what I like? And this isn’t a 9-to-5 job. I’ve still got the time to see the children I love, the grandchildren who are growing up very fast and the cute mate who I still get a kick out of," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Judge Judy has done a number of impressive things during her time in Hollywood, and negotiating her sky-high salary just might be her most impressive feat.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Judge Judy's New Show 'Judy Justice' Will Be Special</a></span></p><h2 id=she-made-millions>She Made Millions</h2><p>So, how much was Judge Judy making while starring in her iconic show?

Don’t treat me as a paid employee. I could make this show without you – I created a deal where I could do that – but you can’t make it without me. I can take Judy Sheindlin anywhere else. And good luck with you if you can find somebody else. Otherwise, let’s share the gift that this program has brought to both of us,’” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Judge Judy</a>.</p><p>The iconic Judge Judy show has come to and end, but the star has moved onto a new show, Judy Justice, on Amazon.</p><p>When speaking on her new show, she said, "We have to deliver a certain number of episodes by December, and then Amazon will make the determination how and when they want to release this show. I don't know. Give me a robe and a case, and I'll do my job. I had wonderful people producing and directing the Judge Judy program, and a couple of them will be following me to Amazon.
