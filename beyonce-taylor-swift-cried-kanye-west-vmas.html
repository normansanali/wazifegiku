Kanye West (before becoming a burgeoning fashion mogul or Kim Kardashian's husband) <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/a11992/taylor-swift-kanye-west-2015-vmas/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cut Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech short" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">cut Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech short</a> to defend Beyoncé, who lost to Swift in the Best Female Video category. "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish,” West said then, lines that are now as iconic as scripture. “But Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beyoncé later gave up her own acceptance speech to bring Swift back onstage. “I remember being 17 years old, up for my first MTV Award with Destiny’s Child, and it was one of the most exciting moments in my life,” Beyoncé said. “So, I’d like for Taylor to come out and have her moment.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, for this incident’s 10th anniversary, an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/8523549/2009-mtv-vmas-oral-history data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="oral history by Billboard" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>oral history by </u><u>Billboard</u></a> reveals that there was a lot more to the story than what we saw onscreen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then-Viacom president, Van Toffler, admitted that West’s interruption was a volatile variable for a show that was usually “tightly scripted to a point.” Making matters worse, Swift still had to endure a live performance after the incident. Toffler said that after the show cut to commercial break, he found Swift and her mother rather disappointed backstage. It also didn't help that the singer had to perform after West's stunt.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Toffler recounted to Billboard, "Her mom and she were crying, and I profusely apologized and I said, 'I'm sorry, we didn't know. I know you have to perform in the next act and let me think about a way we can make it right for you. We're dealing with him now and I'm so sorry it ruined your moment." I didn't anticipate I'd have a crying artist and mom to deal with—literally right before she has to go out on Sixth Avenue and stand on a car and sing her song."</p><img alt="2009 MTV Video Music Awards - Show" title="2009 MTV Video Music Awards - Show" width=3000 height=2006 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-90720454-1566573976.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Kevin Mazur</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Beyoncé brings out Taylor Swift at the 2009 VMAs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to then-MTV senior correspondent James Montgomery, Pink exchanged some heated words with the rapper as soon as the cameras stopped rolling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“During the commercial break, he went back down to his seat and Pink walked up to him and got in his face,” Montgomery said. “I wasn't close enough to hear the conversation, but she was pointing in his face and nodding her head back and forth, and giving him her two cents about how fucked up this was and then stormed off. Then he was sitting there next to Amber Rose with his arm around her, and you could feel everyone in Radio City glaring at his back.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later on, Toffler also caught Beyoncé backstage in tears. That’s when inspiration for a solution struck. He explained how it unfolded to Billboard.</p>"I walk behind the stage -- and sure enough there is Beyoncé and her dad, and she is crying. She was like, 'I didn't know this was going to happen, I feel so bad for her.' And that's when it started to click in my head, and maybe hers, about potentially having the whole arc play out in that one night."I think perhaps for the only time in history at the VMAs -- we knew who was going to win the awards, we had a plan for it [but did not tell the artists ahead of time] -- at some point I let her know that she was probably going to be up on the podium at the end of the show for an award. And wouldn’t it be nice to have Taylor come up and have her moment then? I had to indicate to her that she needed to stay, and perhaps this is a way to have this come full circle and let [Taylor] have her moment. I would normally not say anything, but I had two crying artists."<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And that’s how the 2009 MTV VMAs sausage got made.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Destiny’s Child: Where Are They Now?" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-08-16-at-5-29-13-pm-1565990988.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
