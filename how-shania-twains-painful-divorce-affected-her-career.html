Twain encountered hurdles in her career that almost made her quit at different points. The singer went off the scene over her disturbed vocal cords, but what was meant to be a short hiatus turned into a 15-year hiatus after her ex-husband’s infidelity dealt her a huge blow.</p><h2 id=the-beginning-of-shania-twain-39-s-relationship-with-robert-john-39-mutt-39-lange><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Beginning Of Shania Twain's Relationship With Robert John 'Mutt' Lange</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Any Man Of Mine star met Mutt Lange in 1993 months after they had been communicating on the phone over her music. Shania Twain had released a self-titled album that became a commercial flop and the music producer had offered to produce her next music project. The partnership which was meant for work quickly turned into a steamy romance between the duo. In December 1993, six months after their first physical meeting, the couple tied the knot in an elaborate ceremony.</p><h2 id=shania-twain-and-robert-lange-were-a-musical-power-couple><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Shania Twain And Robert Lange Were A Musical Power Couple</span></h2><p>Shania Twain and Mutt Lange were the musical power couple of the early 2000s. The partnership between the couple was electric. The couple’s collaboration on her second studio album The Woman In Me birthed one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest of all-time top country albums</a>. Although Twain had these ideas for her craft before they met, Lange was the spice she needed to make it colorful. “When you get together with the right person, all the right things seem to start happening,” the songstress said in a chat with Interview Magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lyme-disease-struck-shania-twain><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lyme Disease Struck Shania Twain</span></h2><p>The You’re Still The One star suffered a major setback in her career in 2003. The singer was on tour for her fourth studio album Up. <a href=#>Shania Twain’s voice</a> took a hit when her health began to decline after she was bitten by a tick while horseback riding. The singer lost control of her vocal cords and experienced occasional blackouts on stage. For years, the singer struggled with the disease and thought that it would be the end of her singing career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# title="Are Taylor Swift And Shania Twain Collaborating After Their Recent TikTok Interaction?">Are Taylor Swift And Shania Twain Collaborating After Their Recent TikTok Interaction?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shania-twain-rsquo-s-husband-39-s-infidelity-plunged-her-to-a-new-low><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Shania Twain’s Husband's Infidelity Plunged Her To A New Low</span></h2><p>Amidst struggling with her failing voice chords, the five times Grammy Award winner will discover what she termed her “ultimate betrayal.” Shania discovered her husband, Mutt Lange was having an affair with her best friend Marie-AnneThiébaud, marking the end of her 14-year-old marriage.</p><p>Lange’s infidelity caused the already struggling singer to further shrink into a dark place of pain.

The divorce was eventually finalized in 2010, marking an end to a marriage, and one of the most successful musical couple collaborations.</p><p>The split from her ex-husband caused her to relive layers of pain that she had buried for years. With Mutt Lange out of the picture, she thought it was the end of the road for her music. “Now I'm at a whole other low and I just don’t see any point in going on with a music career,” Twain shared.</p><h2 id=shania-twain-rsquo-s-first-career-blow-wasn-39-t-over-mutt-lange><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Shania Twain’s First Career Blow Wasn't Over Mutt Lange</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer's divorce from her ex-husband dealt a huge blow to her career, but that wasn't the first time the You’re still the One star almost went under. In 1987, Shania’s parents were killed in a tragic road traffic accident.

In 2011, the Man! I Feel Like a Woman star answered Richie's call to feature on his album for a duet on Endless Love. Shania initially turned down Lionel’s request because she felt her voice wasn't up to the task, but the Love singer was able to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">convince her to duet on his track</a>.“I thought that if I fail, I’d rather fail with somebody that is forging and sweet and kind about it,” Twain said about getting back in the studio.</p><h2 id=shania-twain-found-her-spark-again><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Shania Twain Found Her Spark Again</span></h2><p>In August 2017, 15 years after her hiatus from the music scene, Shania Twain announced her return with a post of a Volkswagen bus that read “Summer Of Shania.” It was indeed the summer for the country music star as she released her fifth studio album, Now. Twain’s reentry to music was grand.
