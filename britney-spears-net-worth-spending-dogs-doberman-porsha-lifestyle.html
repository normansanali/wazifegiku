She has struggled in her personal life, getting divorced twice and being placed under a much-publicized conservatorship. Throughout it all, the beloved singer has continued to post on social media, letting fans get small glimpses of her life. While she mostly posts videos that show her love of dancing, Spears sometimes shares about the dogs she has had over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the last few years, Britney Spears has been taking care of a Doberman named Porsha. Considering the fact that Spears has had a high net worth for a long time, it's interesting to see how much cash she spends on her dog.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-britney-spears-spend-on-her-dog-porsha>How Much Money Did Britney Spears Spend On Her Dog Porsha?</h2><p>There are several questions about <a href=#>Sam Asghari and Britney Spears's relationship</a>. But even though some parts of their romance remain hidden, he has done some sweet things for the singer over the years. That includes giving her a Doberman in October 2021, which was a time when she was really struggling. It was also one month before Spears learned that she would no longer be under a conservatorship.</p><p>According to People, Asghari posted about the dog, who they named Porsha, on Instagram. He wrote, "Surprised my fiancé with our newest member to the Family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/two-hollywood-a-listers-might-be-to-blame-for-delayed-britney-spears-memoir.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears has a $70 million net worth</a>, according to Celebrity Net Worth. During the past few years, there have been many stories about the money that Britney Spears shells out for her dogs.</p><p>There aren't any numbers available about the money that Spears has paid for her Doberman Porsha. However, there have been a lot of news stories that detail how much she pays for her lifestyle. Since she spends a lot, it's possible that she does the same for Porsha.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/how-much-of-britney-spears-net-worth-is-spent-on-her-doberman-porscha-s-lavish-lifestyle_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Entertainment Tonight, people found out what Spears spent because of her court trial to end her conservatorship. In 2018, four evenings at the Montage Beverly Hills Hotel cost her more than $16,000. That barely made a dent, though, and her 2018 travel expenses were almost $70,000.</p><p>ET also reported that Spears paid a little more than $400,000 on "living expenses" and her "household supplies" cost over $66,000. She shopped at stores like 7-Eleven, Walmart, Home Depot, and Target.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Simon Cowell Regretted Hiring Britney Spears For X-Factor.

She wrote, “Thank you for dogs" and added that "dogs are extraordinary animals" before sharing that she encountered Sawyer when she was on vacation in Maui.</p><p>She said, "He held me so tight when I held him that I literally couldn’t leave the place," according to Billboard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Us Weekly reported that Spears also said of Sawyer on Instagram, "It’s funny … he doesn’t talk back but it’s like he understands what I’m saying.”</p><p>Spears also has dogs named Daisy and Sara Beth. Several years ago, she took care of London, who was a Yorkshire terrier. She also had Lucky and Bit Bit, who were Chihuahuas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/britney-spears-banned-most-of-her-family-from-her-wedding-to-sam-asghari-and-those-who-were-invited-didn-t-even-show-up.jpg><p>Sadly, Britney Spears has gone through some hard times with her dogs. According to The U.S. Sun, an employee of Spears's had a vet see one of the dogs, and Spears wasn't happy about that. Reports came out that Spears and the employee got into a heated fight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A source explained to The U.S. Sun that this was just speculation and not actually true. The source said, ”Britney did not hit her housekeeper, she didn't hit anybody. She had no physical contact with anyone in her household. There was an argument on Monday over one of Britney's dogs which led to cops being called but there were no injuries, not even a scratch. Cops being called was an exaggerated reaction to the situation."</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-britney-spears-spend-on-her-dogs-in-the-past>How Much Money Did Britney Spears Spend On Her Dogs In The Past?</h2><p>Britney Spears has had many dogs over the years, and she has always shelled out tons of cash for them. Based on these numbers, it seems likely that she is spending the same kind of cash on her Doberman Porsha.</p><p>In 2014, TMZ reported that the singer spent $31,234.15 on her two dogs at the time. She paid $5,205 for food and someone to watch the dogs. She also paid $1,585 for clothes for the dogs.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ed McMahon Interviewing 10-Year-Old Britney Spears Illustrates Everything That's Wrong With The Industry</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spears also spent thousands when she purchased the dogs.

News reported in 2016 that Spears paid $38,000 for various expenses related to her dogs in 2015.</p><p>Since Spears has so much money, it doesn't seem like it's a problem for her to pay a lot in order for her dogs to live a nice lifestyle. They all seem to have the best of the best when it comes to clothes, grooming, and care.</p><p>The singer is still paying a lot for her dogs in 2023.
