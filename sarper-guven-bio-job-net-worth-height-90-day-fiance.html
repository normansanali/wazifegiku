Their sexual chemistry was off the charts, and after only two days, they both fell head over heels for each other. However, her friends and family weren’t happy with this and they warned Shekinah that Sarper really was a playboy, and she was repeating a pattern of falling for an attractive man despite the red flags. But Shekinah insisted that this time was different, and proceeded to get engaged to him.</span></p><p><span>Once abroad, Shekinah then tries to lay down ground rules for Sarper. The “retired bad boy” balks at her efforts to control him. In fact, the more time they spent together, the more shocking discoveries they made, leading the lovebirds to question how well they really know each other.</span></p><p><span>This is exactly the kind of drama viewers sign up for once they start watching the </span><i><span>90-Day Fiance</span></i><span> franchise. </span><i><span>The Other Wa</span></i><span>y is exactly what it sounds like — American couples who move to their partner’s home country. “It’s about love,” the show’s executive producer, Matt Sharp said. “Love is primal, but I think we tapped into a couple of things. One is that this show is incredibly authentic. I’m a huge lover of The Bachelor and that franchise, however, we were one of the first shows to actually tell real stories about ordinary Americans and their love journeys.”</span></p><h3><b>Are Shekinah Garner And Sarper Güven Still Together?</b></h3><p><span>The duo didn’t reveal their relationship status. But based on the posts they make on their joint social media account, Shekinah Garner And Sarper Güven could still be together.</span></p><p><span>In fact, the lovebirds flooded their IG @</span><a href=#><span>shekinahsarper90day</span></a><span> with lovey-dovey pictures while </span><i><span>90 Day Fiance: The Other Way</span></i><span> was still ongoing.
