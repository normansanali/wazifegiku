Even her husband (since 2018) Andr√© Murillo shared an emotional clip from one of his wife‚Äôs songs following news of her hospitalization for blood clots. Tori‚Äôs mother Laura Kelly has been just broken no doubt. So, in this writing, we thought we would introduce to fans who their favorite diva‚Äôs mother is.</p><h3><strong>Meet Laura Kelly, Tori Kelly‚Äôs Mother</strong></h3><p>Tori Kelly was born on 14 December 1992 in Wildomar, California to her father, <a href=#>Allwyn</a>, and mother Laura. And of course, Tori is not their only kid. She has a younger brother named <a href=#>Noah</a>.</p><p>Growing up, Tori was exposed to a variety of music by her parents. ‚ÄúI give them a lot of credit for just playing all different genres, and no genre was off limits,‚Äù Tori had said once when asked about her upbringing. Tori and her family are Christian. So, faith plays a part in Tori‚Äôs songwriting, despite her not considering herself a part of the Christian music genre.</p><p>Speaking of Tori‚Äôs mom, she is a really proud mother. On her social media, she posts more about her kids and their achievements than talk about herself. The matriarch is just as much supportive and loving towards her son Noah Kelly (on IG <a href=#>@noahjameskelly</a>). He turned 25 in August 2021.</p><h3><strong>Is Laura Kelly Still Married To Tori Kelly‚Äôs Father?</strong></h3><p>Laura Kelly is no more together and married to Tori Kelly‚Äôs father, Allwyn Kelly.

In August 2019, the artist released her third studio album, ‚ÄúInspired by True Events.‚Äù She then deemed this coming-of-age record her ‚Äúmost vulnerable album to date‚Äù. She said she drew inspiration for this from several painful events in her life, including her parents‚Äô divorce and the death of her grandfather. Yet, to Forbes, she said it was not intentional and it just happened.</p><p>Laura‚Äôs former husband, Allwyn is a construction worker. He claims to have run several projects in Southern California for well over two decades. For a while now, he has been his own business, AK Builders, which he posts about on his social media accounts.</p><h3><strong>Laura Kelly Age</strong></h3><p>Laura Denise Kelly was born in 1967.

When she speaks, her words are wise, and she gives instructions with kindness.‚Äù In February 2023, the matriarch should have turned 81 years old.</p><p>Oftentimes on social media, Laura also has talked about and featured her two siblings (a brother and a sister) and has gushed about their close resemblances mostly.</p><h3><strong>Laura Kelly Job</strong></h3><p>Laura Kelly is an aesthetics nurse with training and certifications in neuromodulators, fillers, PRP therapy, and the Plasma Pen.
