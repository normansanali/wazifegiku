Even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez loves the new T-Swift album</a>! I mean....who wouldn't?</p><p>Swift's new song 'Willow' is particularly special and the singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded a "witch" remix</a> of it. People are saying that there are some tunes off evermore that are about some of the people Taylor Swift has dated in the past, including Jake Gyllenhaal, sparking up interest in their relationship and the reason why they broke up.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Jake Gyllenhaal's Relationship With His Sister, Maggie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on August 5th, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong> Jake Gyllenhaal and Taylor Swift dated between 2010 and 2011 causing quite the media frenzy. Despite their romance, Jake called things off after he felt their relationship was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">receiving too much media coverage</a>. In addition, reps from Gyllenhaal's camp claimed that their age difference also played a role in their break-up. Despite his side of the story, many believe that Jake ended things so he could date Jenny Lewis. A decade later and the duo aren't in touch, however, their careers are doing stellar. Taylor is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">set to release Red (Taylor's Version)</a> on November 19, while Jake Gyllenhaal could be landing a lead in a Stephen King film.</p><h2 id=the-romance-amp-the-break-up>The Romance & The Break-Up</h2><p>These days, Taylor Swift is in a happy romance and it's possible that she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">met Joe Alwyn at the 2016 Met Gala</a>. According to MTV.com, Swift and Gyllenhaal seemed to meet each other in October 2010 when Emma Stone, with who Swift is pals, was hosting Saturday Night Live. The three stars met for lunch in Brooklyn after that and then by November, it seemed like Swift and Gyllenhaal were dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gyllenhaal ended the romance</a> and, according to Vogue, Swift shared her viewpoint on herself: "I think I am smart unless I am really, really in love, and then I am ridiculously stupid.”</p><p>The singer shared that she was currently single and said, “I got nothing going on! I just don’t really feel like dating. I really have this great life right now, and I’m not sad and I’m not crying this Christmas, so I am really stoked about that.”</p><p>Swift also said that album number four was going to be about her broken heart: she explained, "There’s just been this earth-shattering, not recent, but absolute crash-and-burn heartbreak and that will turn out to be what the next album is about."</p><p>That album was Red and according to Capital FM, many people believe that those songs are about Jake Gyllenhaal. By the time 2011 rolled around, things were over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So why did their romance come to an end? Capital FM says that the general belief is that Gyllenhaal wasn't okay with the lack of privacy that came along with dating someone like Swift who is always in the spotlight.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Songs Taylor Swift Has Written About Her Boyfriend Joe Alwyn</a></span></p><h2 id=two-songs-about-jake>Two Songs About Jake?</h2><p>People often say that Taylor Swift writes her songs about heartbreak and that seems to be the case with Jake Gyllenhaal. According to ET Canada, her new song "Coney Island" on evermore appears to mention Gyllenhaal as she sings the lyrics "Were you standing in the hallway/with a big cake, happy birthday."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans think that when Swift wrote her song "The Moment I Knew" for her album Red, she was talking about Gyllenhaal because the tune is about how she was lonely during her birthday and the person she loved didn't come to her party.</p><p>Those song lyrics go, "Christmas lights glisten/I've got my eye on the door/Just waiting for you to walk in/But the time is ticking." At the end of the song, she sings, You called me later/And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"/And I said, "I'm sorry, too"/And that was the moment I knew."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even Jake's sister Maggie Gyllenhaal has gotten some interview questions about Taylor Swift's music. Fans know that in her song "All Too Well," she talked about a scarf: the lyrics go, "And I left my scarf there at your sister's house/And you've still got it in your drawer even now."</p><h2 id=did-jake-leave-taylor-for-jenny-lewis>Did Jake Leave Taylor For Jenny Lewis?</h2><p>The romance between Swift and Gyllenhaal seemed super cozy, as they were often photographed walking around the fall of 2010, wearing coats and scarves and holding take-out cups of coffee.</p><p>When it comes to this couple's break-up, people have definitely had a lot to say, and some people said Gyllenhaal ended the relationship <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">so the actor could date Jenny Lewis</a>.</p><p>According to Cheat Sheet, Jenny Lewis and Jake Gyllenhaal were each other's dates for the Golden Globes in early 2011. Or at least that's what people assumed, but according to Lewis, it was platonic.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s How Taylor Swift Earned $90 Million In 2020</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-do-the-two-stand-today>Where Do The Two Stand Today?</h2><p>Considering their relationship ended over a decade ago, it is safe to say that Taylor and Jake are definitely over one another. Although the two do not stay in touch, it's safe to say that their breakup didn't hinder either of their careers.</p><p>As Jake Gyllenhaal went on to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he is now lined up to appear in a Stephen King film after the writer made it clear he had a lead role in mind for the actor. As for his love life, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake is currently dating Jeanne Cadieu</a> and has been since late 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Taylor, the singer remained in a committed relationship with her cats, and fans are totally happy with that considering it's giving her more time to create music. Most recently, Taylor announced that this upcoming November, fans will be able to get their hands on her very own version of the singer's album, Red.</p><p>"Sometimes you need to talk it over for it to ever really be...over...This will be the first time you hear all 30 songs that were meant to go on Red. And hey, one of them is even ten minutes long," Taylor wrote on Instagram.</p><p>The album, Red (Taylor's Version) is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">set to drop on November 19</a>, and we cannot wait!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>8 Times Taylor Swift Was Featured On Songs By Other Artists</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbaledOasKWnomLAuLXFrWSappRit6K3xGaesqScmruprcClZJuqlZa4bsHPaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-does-orville-peck-cover-his-face.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Does Orville Peck Cover His face?">&larr;
