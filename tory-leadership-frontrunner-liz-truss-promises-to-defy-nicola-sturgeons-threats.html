If I become Prime Minister, I would not grant that authority.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We are in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis and it is an increasingly uncertain time for the world, so the SNP should be focusing on delivering for the Scottish people and fixing the mistakes they have made in policing, education and beyond.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘As Prime Minister, I will hold them to account. No longer will they be able to neglect the needs of the Scottish people and blame it on Westminster in their pursuit of independence.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This tough stance comes as Ms Truss welcomes former leadership contender Tom Tugendhat to her team – and as her staunch supporter Nadine Dorries today unleashes a blistering attack on Mr Sunak.</p><img decoding=async id=i-e5019332e521ec94 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/30/22/60885459-11065367-image-a-150_1659217125230.jpg height=951 width=634 alt="She is expected to rebuff calls from the SNP and Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon (pictured), for another vote on the issue" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>She is expected to rebuff calls from the SNP and Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon (pictured), for another vote on the issue</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a no-holds-barred article for The Mail on Sunday, the Culture Secretary defends her controversial decision to contrast Ms Truss’s £4.50 earrings with Mr Sunak’s £450 Prada shoes.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>Day Liz told Rishi he’d lost chance to be PM&nbsp;</h3><p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold">By Glen Owen, Political Editor for The Mail on Sunday</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Foreign Secretary privately warned Rishi Sunak last year that his NHS National Insurance rise would ruin his leadership chances, sources close to her have said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The row over the rise was so bitter that No10 feared Liz Truss would resign from the Cabinet when it was discussed last autumn, the sources added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 1.25 per cent rise was due to be rubber-stamped by the Cabinet at a meeting last September, but Ms Truss was so late that Downing Street feared she had quit.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When she did arrive at the meeting, she made it clear that she thought the rise was ‘un-Conservative’.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Truss has repeated that view during the campaign, arguing that raising taxes in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis was ‘morally wrong’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The increase was also opposed by Jacob Rees-Mogg.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A source said: ‘Liz and Jacob broke ranks to make clear that they were opposed to the NI hike.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Liz told Rishi afterwards that he had torpedoed his chances of ever becoming PM, or words to that effect.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She admits that this caused ‘a bit of a storm’ but dismisses the idea that she was being ‘anti-aspirational’, declaring: ‘I would never wish to suppress anyone’s desire to improve their lot.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Dorries, who insists that Mr Sunak had long been plotting to oust Boris Johnson, writes: ‘No, my Twitter comment ran much deeper. I wanted to highlight Rishi’s misguided sartorial style in order to alert Tory members not to be taken in by appearances in the way that happened to many of us who served with the Chancellor in Cabinet.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She then makes an extraordinary jibe at Mr Sunak’s height (5ft 7in), saying: ‘The assassin’s gleaming smile, his gentle voice and even his diminutive stature had many of us well and truly fooled.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a scathing verdict on Mr Sunak’s alleged plotting, she adds: ‘His actions made Michael Gove’s betrayal of Boris Johnson during the 2016 leadership campaign appear like a rank amateur rehearsing for the role of Brutus in a village-hall play.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile, Ms Truss’s leadership ambitions have also been endorsed by leading anti-woke Tory MP Sir John Hayes, who hailed her ‘character and determination’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Speaking to the MoS, Sir John – chairman of the influential Common Sense Group of Tory MPs and peers – singled out Ms Truss’s clear answer at a hustings in Leeds last week when she defended the return of single-sex toilets in schools after the introduction of same-sex spaces during the pandemic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But he also saluted her belief in Britain: ‘What impresses me about Liz is that she is unprepared to accept the orthodoxy of decline. She believes, as I do, that Britain’s greatest years can lie ahead. This confident patriotism is essential in an increasingly challenging and uncertain world.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sir John, who backed Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch earlier in the leadership race, declined to criticise Mr Sunak, saying: ‘I rate him as a very capable politician.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, he also told the MoS: ‘There is something particular about Liz Truss that could make her a very great Prime Minister.’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKS%2FunnLnpidnaKotaq8jJ%2BpqKakp8KvusSrZKWhqmLBs8HSrGSpqp%2BitrSx0marqGWUmrO6ec2imqikkWLAtcHRoJyopqNiwam%2BxJqrrGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./weird-al-net-worth-2024-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Weird Al Net Worth 2024">&larr;
