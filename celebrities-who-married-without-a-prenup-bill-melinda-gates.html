Many a time, the spouse who brings it up is always on the losing end since there are trust issues that emerge. The other party is likely to think the worst.

For couples without a prenuptial agreement, the least successful of the two is likely to benefit the most by being entitled to a portion of the hard worker’s wealth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>No Prenup: How Much Did Charlie Sheen Have To Pay Denise Richards?</a></span></p><p>In celebville, we’ve seen smart couples, who, despite having extremely high income by the time their marriage collapsed, got the short end of the stick because of lack of a prenup.
