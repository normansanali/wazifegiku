How close are these actresses?</p><h2 id=lili-camila-amp-madelaine-launched-a-joint-tiktok-account><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Lili, Camila,&nbsp;& Madelaine Launched A Joint TikTok Account</span></h2><p>The TikTok account created by&nbsp;Lili Reinhart, Camila Mendes, and Madelaine Petsch is called&nbsp;<a class=external-link href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@blondebrunetteredhead</a>. It is already a huge hit and they are already creating some really fun content for their fans.

We both come from such different backgrounds that I think it took us a while to find some common ground. But once the walls came down and our inner goofballs began to reveal themselves, we were unstoppable, and now it's almost like we speak our own language. I've learned from Lili that the true value of a friend lies within their ability to listen. A good listener goes a long way." The friendship bond between these beauties obviously runs very deep.</p><h2 id=camila-guest-starred-in-madelaine-s-halloween-youtube-video><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Camila Guest Starred In Madelaine's Halloween YouTube Video</span></h2><p>Due to <a href=#>COVID-19 restrictions</a>, Camila Mendes and Madelaine Petsch were not able to go out and party for Halloween. They were stuck at home, celebrating responsibly instead which is very smart since they have so many young and impressionable fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Cast Of Riverdale, Ranked By Their Instagram Followers</a></span></p><p>They showed off their Halloween costumes, played with their pups, and shared an interesting conversation for their fans to listen to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=camila-madelaine-amp-lili-walk-their-dogs-together><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Camila, Madelaine, & Lili Walk Their Dogs Together</span></h2><p>True friends take care of their dogs together! That is obviously the case for Madelaine Petsch, Camila Mendes, and Lili Rinehart who were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted out in Vancouver walking their dogs together</a>. They are&nbsp;all dog moms so they can easily relate when it comes to knowing how much responsibility comes along with taking care of a dog. A lot of time, energy, and effort go into taking care of puppies but these three beauties turn it into a bonding experience.</p><h2 id=lili-guest-starred-in-madelaine-s-tie-dye-youtube-video><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lili&nbsp;Guest Starred In Madelaine's&nbsp;Tie-Dye YouTube Video</span></h2><p>Madelaine added a new YouTube video to her channel with Lili Reinhart as the guest star.

Friends push each other to leave their comfort zones, and Camila has definitely encouraged me to come out of my shell in social situations. She's a social butterfly and I'm more introverted. It's a good balance." Friends do encourage each other to be their best selves. They seem to be a great match.</p><h2 id=lili-camila-amp-madelaine-dressed-up-as-the-powerpuff-girls><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lili, Camila, & Madelaine Dressed Up As The Powerpuff Girls</span></h2><p>The friendship between this trio couldn't be more obvious. They posed together as <a href=#>The Powerpuff Girls</a> and it was seriously the cutest thing ever. The reason this costume works so well is that the Powerpuff Girls characters share the same hair colors as the trip. Bubbles is a blonde, just like Lili Reinhart. Blossom is a redhead, just like Madelaine Petsch. Buttercup is a brunette, just like Camila Mendes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lili-camila-amp-madelaine-attend-parties-together><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lili, Camila, & Madelaine&nbsp;Attend Parties Together</span></h2><p>Lili Reinhart, Camila Mendes, and Madelaine Petsch were pictured in attendance at The Oscar's Afterparty at the beginning of 2020. Back in February, before everything closed down and all events got canceled, the award show was still in full force. The trio spent time socializing with other actors and celebs at the afterparty.</p><h2 id=camila-feels-lucky-to-experience-everything-with-lili><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Camila Feels Lucky To Experience Everything With Lili</span></h2><p>Going through the intense changes that come along with rising fame is something only a few people can understand. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Camila Mendes explained</a>, "[My] friendship [with Lili] has only gotten stronger since the show's release. Everything is so new for both of us, and we're so lucky to be able to experience the chaos together. It definitely makes it a lot easier for us to cope with the changes."&nbsp; They are on the same page about how it feels to suddenly be known by people everywhere they go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lili-revealed-that-there-is-no-behind-the-scenes-female-rivalry-going-on><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Lili Revealed That There Is No Behind-The-Scenes Female Rivalry Going On</span></h2><p>While talking about Camila Mendes, Lili Reinhart squashed any rumors about rivalry behind the scenes. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She said</a>, "It makes me happy to see that people support our friendship and they know that we really are friends and there's no weird, secret behind the scenes rivalry going on. It's cool to me that people can see our real-life chemistry translate through our Betty and Veronica scenes." Betty and Veronica might have a bit of a rivalry but the world needs to remember that those are fictional characters.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Did Nina Dobrev Just Hint She's Going To Be On 'Riverdale'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dqbWmecWepJqklah6sLKMq6CvnaKZrq2xjJqara2Robm6ecWroJ6mlKh6qr7LaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dateline-explores-shannon-melendi-murder-where-is-killer-butch-hinton-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dateline Explores Shannon Melendi Murder: Where Is Killer Butch Hinton Today?">&larr;
