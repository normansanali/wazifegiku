He had attained his 3rd and final ‘Grandmaster’ norm at the Gredine Open in Italy in June 2018.</li><li>At the age of 12 years, 10 months, and 13 days, he was the then 2nd-youngest person ever to have achieved the rank of ‘Grandmaster’ after Sergey Karjakin (12 years and 7 months).</li><li>In July 2019, he had won the Xtracon Chess Open in Denmark with a score of 8.5 out of a possible 10 points. In October 2019, he had won the World Youth Championships in the under-18 section with a score of 9 out of a possible 11 points.

He had scored 15.5 out of a possible 19 points.</li><li>This had helped him qualify for the Meltwater Champions Chess Tour, a 10-month long series of 10 online chess tournaments featuring the world’s top players who compete for a prize money pool of USD 1.5 million. He had competed in one of those 10 tournaments and had finished in 12th place there, ending up in the joint 20th position overall on the tour in a field of 44 participants.</li><li>At the Chess World Cup 2021, a 206-player single-elimination chess tournament that was held in Sochi, Russia, he had reached the 4th round (last 32 players) of the tournament.
