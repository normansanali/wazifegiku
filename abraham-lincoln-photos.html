Like anything that comes into the world while you’re a young adult, men of Lincoln’s generation found photography very exciting and often commemorated important milestones by sitting for a portrait. Lincoln, who was a prominent lawyer in Illinois before becoming an even more prominent politician, sat for more than his share of pictures.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Fates decreed that the life of Abraham Lincoln was to be filled with grief, and the years left their marks on the man’s face like a well-worn dirt track. Sadly, though Abraham Lincoln lived in an age of photographs, he died a generation before we could capture his (thin and reedy, by all accounts) voice, leaving this (largely) photographic record as almost all we have of him.</p><img alt="Abraham Lincoln Photos First Portrait" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lincoln-first-portrait.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>This is the earliest known image of the 16th president. It's a Daguerreotype taken in 1847, immediately before Lincoln was sworn in as a member of the 30th Congress. He had pledged to serve only a single term in Washington, but his time in Congress was marked by a fierce opposition to the Mexican War and, especially, to the exceptional war powers granted to the president—an opposition he would eventually regret. This picture was taken by Nicholas Shepard, who had briefly studied law at Lincoln's firm in Springfield.

In this picture, the dapper 45-year-old Lincoln happens to be dressed for a night out with friends. George Schneider, the publisher of a German-language abolitionist paper, invited Lincoln out for the evening and suggested they stop by a studio for a portrait. The paper Lincoln is holding is the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, Schneider's paper.

Lincoln reportedly wasn't happy with the request, as he disliked the way his face looked in pictures. Joseph Medill, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, was present for this sitting. According to him, the photographer tried to smooth down Lincoln's hair, which must have pissed him off, because he immediately ran his fingers through his hair and created this mess here. The original negative of this picture was reportedly lost in the Great Chicago Fire. Thanks, Mrs. O'Leary.

This was one of the few portraits of himself Lincoln liked, and he kept a copy for himself. The original is in the Illinois State Historical Library. This picture was taken of Lincoln in 1857, just a few weeks after what history remembers as "the infamous" Dred Scott decision was handed down. The Supreme Court's action, in ruling that blacks were not citizens anywhere in the country, practically guaranteed that war would come—soon—and that the abolitionist Republican Party would lead one faction of it.

According to a letter Cole wrote 50 years later, Lincoln said to him: "I cannot see why all you artists want a likeness of me unless it is because I am the homeliest man in the State of Illinois." This was another rare portrait Lincoln liked; he would go on to use it during his 1860 campaign and even sign copies of it for admirers.

The only opposition he faced was the Republican candidate, Abraham Lincoln. It was during their famous debates that Lincoln said: "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half-slave and half-free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other." Lincoln lost the election, which was decided in the Illinois Legislature along strict party lines.

It's difficult to tell, but in this picture he's suppressing a laugh. According to J. O. Cunningham, who was present for the sitting, Lincoln arrived for the picture in a shabby coat, which was all he had at the time. The photographer, Samuel Alschuler, offered Lincoln his own coat, which was almost a foot short on each arm. Lincoln "laughed immoderately" at the spectacle, and tried to keep it under control for the 10-second exposure.

Among his friends and neighbors, it had become something of a joke. On seeing this 1858 Ambrotype, however, nearly all agreed it was the best likeness of the man they had ever seen. Before the shoot, the artist suggested Mr. Lincoln "freshen up a bit." Lincoln, who was painfully self-aware, quipped that it wouldn't be much of a likeness if he freshened up.

The woman he called "Mother" after that was his stepmother, who married Abraham's father when he was a teenager. This portrait was made at her request, though Lincoln's handwritten note read: "This is not a very good-looking picture, but it's the best that could be produced from the poor subject."

This is the first picture of Abraham Lincoln to have been taken by Matthew Brady, who practically invented battlefield journalism and brought the Civil War into every home in the country. A shot like this really shows off what a professional Brady was. He fixed Lincoln's hair, turned up his collar, staged the scene with books, and did what he could to manage Lincoln's lazy left eye with positioning and touch-up work later on. Of this picture, which was plastered on newspapers nationwide, Lincoln would later say: "Brady and the Cooper Institute made me President."

It is believed to have been taken in the spring or summer of 1860, it's probably the only print from the negative, and Lincoln doesn't look like hot death in it; that's all we have. We don't even know the name of the artist.

Lincoln is in Decatur, at the Republican Party convention. Before TV was a thing, political parties used to organize statewide conventions and coordinate activities. Lincoln gave an address to the convention on May 10, but had to deal with party business throughout the event. If you look very closely, you can see the cord running into his coat which holds his reading glasses. Nine days after this portrait, Abraham Lincoln would rise to accept his party's nomination for the office of President.

They're notable for two reasons: first, this was the first time Lincoln had been photographed (previous portraits were all Daguerreotypes or Ambrotypes), and second, Lincoln uncharacteristically loved this picture. He said: "That looks better and expresses me better than any I have ever seen. If it pleases the people I am satisfied."

He stood 6'4", and his arms dangled like loose fire hoses at his sides. Despite his gangly appearance, Lincoln was freakishly strong. As a young man, he earned quite a bit of respect around town by challenging local toughs to wrestling matches. He had a knack for lifting his opponents at arm's length and tossing them. In 12 years of wrestling, he only seems to have lost once. Bizarrely, he wasn't the only wrestling president. Theodore Roosevelt, Zachary Taylor, Ulysses S. Grant, Chester A. Arthur, Andrew Jackson, and George Goddamn Washington were all wrestlers. Somebody animate this <i>now</i>!

Photographer William Shaw gave this picture, taken for a Chicago newspaper, such a heroic going-over that it's practically a composite sketch. In this picture, Lincoln has no wrinkles, no bags under his eyes, and barely any shadow on his face, as if the light is in love with him and can't bear to be parted. As long as we're faking things, would it have killed Shaw to touch up that hemmed lapel?

That dumb story about the 11-year-old girl writing to him and suggesting the beard is, like many other dumb stories, absolutely true. Grace Bedell wrote to then-candidate Lincoln, saying: "All the ladies like whiskers and they would tease their husbands to vote for you and then you would be President." Lincoln worried that a beard would look like a silly affectation, which it certainly was, but he took the suggestion and a trademark look was born.

His election was the signal for South Carolina to secede from the union, and many other states followed right after. Jefferson Davis was actually chosen and inaugurated as president of the Confederate States of America before Lincoln could be installed. Lincoln left Illinois two days after this picture was taken and took a slow train to the capital. The next time he crossed into Illinois would be for his funeral.

The invasion came to grief on the banks of Antietam Creek, where an average of one man died every minute for eight hours. Lee withdrew, but McClellan failed to pursue. This picture was taken a few weeks after the battle, while the Union Army was <i>still</i> paralyzed and inactive. Lincoln made the trip out to plead with McClellan to move on Virginia, only for the general to temporize further. A month after this picture was taken, Lincoln had had enough; he fired George McClellan for good. Antietam was close enough to a victory that it was all the excuse Lincoln needed to finally issue the Emancipation Proclamation.

Between July 1 and 3, 1863, the largest battle ever fought in the Western Hemisphere raged across Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. On the last day of the battle, 12,500 men under Confederate George Pickett marched into Union guns in the center of the battle line. Only around half of them made it back—most of them with a limp—and Lee's second (and last) invasion of the North was decisively repulsed. The next day, July 4, the last Confederate outpost on the Mississippi River, Vicksburg, surrendered to General U.S. Grant. In this picture, taken around that time, Lincoln is posed wearing the gold watch chain he was given by a delegation of Californians. He made a habit of wearing it.

Instead, it was intended to serve as a study for an official oil painting. Nobody remembers the stupid painting. The photograph, however, is remembered for showing the awful toll the years had taken on Lincoln's face. As this picture was taken, Atlanta had been burned to ashes, Sherman's army had reached the sea and turned north, and Lee's dwindling army was running for its life . . . a run that would end near Appomattox Courthouse.

With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."
