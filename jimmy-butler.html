He owns a company called <i>Bigface Brand Coffee</i> which has been a huge hit. The athlete is also signed by the shoe brand Li-Ning which pays him a lot of money to wear their sneakers.&nbsp;</p><p>Butler also owns a lot of expensive stuff.

He also owns cars like Mercedes-Maybach <i>GLS, Porsche 911 Carrera S</i>, and <i>2017 Toyota Sienna</i>.</p><h2>Who Is Jimmy Butler's Girlfriend?</h2><p>As of now, Jimmy Butler is in a relationship with <strong>Kaitlin Nowak</strong>. She is a model by profession. This lovely couple first met somewhere in <strong>2019</strong> and have been together since.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/2/15/17817655_1743751222581551_5181103294948311040_n%20(1)-1676458566907.jpg><p>Butler and Nowak prefer to keep their relationship private. And hence, the couple hasn't disclosed much about their love life. Jimmy and Kaitlin also haven't posted anything about their significant other on social media.</p><h2>Did Butler Date Selena Gomez? Plus, Previous Relationships</h2><p>Miami Heats, Jimmy Butler was rumored to have dated pop singer <strong>Selena Gomez</strong> in the past. The famous rumor started after the two were found having dinner together. The two have been seen hanging out on a couple of other occasions, too, which led to the rumor that he broke up with Nowak and started dating the <i>Calm Down</i> singer.</p><p>But Gomez isn't the only woman Butler has been rumored to be dating. Besides rumor, he has a long list of women he has dated. Jimmy has been linked with <strong>Rachel A. DeMita</strong>, <strong>Kawahine Andrade</strong>, <strong>Lolo Jones</strong>, <strong>Shay Mitchell</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Charmaine Piula</strong></a>, and <strong>Iggy Azalea</strong>.</p><h2>Has A Daughter</h2><p>Jimmy Butler has yet to take on the husband's role, but he has already taken on the part of a father, thanks to his daughter. <strong>Rylee Butler</strong> was born in <strong>October 2019</strong>,<strong> </strong>and her mother is his girlfriend, Kaitlin Nowak.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/2/15/Screenshot_20230215_164407%20(1)-1676458793502.jpg><p>Rylee changed a lot of things for the Miami Heat shooting guard from her birth. A lot of things he did, particularly workouts, got affected after the birth of his daughter. When there is a baby in the house, a lot of time and care must be given. And Butler did precisely that.</p><p>Butler also wants to be a good father to his daughter. Something that he didn't experience growing up himself. <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>CBS News</i></a> mentions that he wants his daughter to grow up believing that she can do anything and not confine herself to gender roles, and also don't get scared of any situation they face.</p><h2>Body Measurements: What Is The Height Of The Basketball Athlete?</h2><p>Butler is a well-built athlete, as his body measurements are <strong>44-34-38 </strong>inches. He is one of the tallest athletes in the sport, as he has the same height as <a href=#><strong>Issac Bonga</strong></a> at 6 Feet and 8 Inches<strong> </strong>(203 cm). Plus, he has a body weight of <strong>236 lbs</strong> (107 kg).&nbsp;</p><p>The Miami Heat athlete wears a shoe size of <strong>14 (US)</strong>. You can tell he puts in a lot of work on his upper body as his biceps measure <strong>16.5 inches</strong>. Being a professional athlete, you need to be in good shape to make it.&nbsp;</p><p>To make his body in shape, Butler follows a diet routine. He has been playing in the NBA for many years now. Meaning he has been keeping himself in shape for a long time.</p><h2>Who Are Jimmy Butler's Mom & Dad?</h2><p>Butler was raised well by his parents, except he was raised by those who weren't his actual parents. His surrogate parents were <strong>Michael Lambert </strong>and <strong>Michelle Lambert</strong>. His biological parents are <strong>Jimmy Butler II </strong>and<strong> Londa Butler</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/2/15/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg%20(2)%20(2)%20(1)-1676459204131.jpg><p>Michael and Michelle adopted Butler because he has nowhere else to go. But he was kicked out of his house by his mother. Londa threw him out when Butler was only thirteen.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy met his surrogate family through his parent's son, <strong>Jordan Leslie</strong>, whom he met at a basketball camp. Upon learning about Butler's situation, they decided to adopt him. He had seven siblings after his adoption.</p><p>The biological father of Butler, Jimmy II, had left him and his mother when he was still a child. And his mother didn't like him and was told to leave the house. All the struggles at such a young age shaped him into the man he is today.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy's mother ditched him when he was 13, but he has forgiven her. The mother-son relationship has healed today.</p><h2>A Brief On Jimmy's Achievements</h2><p>Jimmy has been playing at the top level for a very long time.

And, with his sport, he was also pursuing his education. He did his studies in <strong>communication studies</strong>. He got his degree from Marquette University, where he was from <strong>2008</strong> to <strong>2011</strong>.</p><p>Before Marquette, Butler studied at <i>Tyler Junior College</i> for a year, from <strong>2007</strong> to <strong>2008</strong>.
