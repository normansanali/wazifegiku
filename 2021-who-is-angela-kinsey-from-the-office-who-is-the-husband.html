Thanks to this, she has now become a big actress who has been very active in her profession for more than 20 years now, and her works in both the television and movies speak for her. Angela has won 3 awards for her exceptional performance in the popular television series The Suits, with 2 coming from the Screen Actors Guild for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy series.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Who is Angela Kinsey?">Who is Angela Kinsey?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Who is Her Husband?">Who is Her Husband?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-angela-kinsey></span><strong>Who is Angela Kinsey?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Angela Faye Kinsey was born in Lafayette, Louisiana in the United States of America on the 25th of June, 1971. Her father works in the Oil and Gas industry as a drilling engineer, and in order to provide for his family, he had to move to wherever his skills and experience were needed most, which was to Jakarta, Indonesia in 1973 when Angela was just 2.</p><p>She began her education at the Jarkata Intercultural School – which is the biggest school in the country for children of foreign expatriates working there. She had her primary and secondary education at the institution; as a child growing up she learned and naturally picked up the Indonesian language, and she still routinely speaks the language till date. In 1985, her father relocated his family back to the United States and they settled down in Archer City, Texas.</p><p>Angela Kinsey continued her education at Baylor University in Waco, Texas where she decided to study the English Language, and graduated with a Bachelors of Arts degree in 1993. In an interview several years after leaving college, Angela revealed that she took a lot of theater courses while she was in Baylor, and that was deliberate to enhance her career as an actress later on. Her first job after graduation was as an intern on the popular television show “Late Night with Conan O’Brien and she worked directly with Max Weinberg, who was the show’s bandleader/drummer.</p><p>For her professional acting career, Angela Kinsey kicked it off in 1997 on a TV show titled “King of the Hall”, lending her voice to a character called Angela. She had a few more minor roles in TV shows like “Step By Step”, “Run of The House”, etc., till she landed her first major TV role in 2005 on “The Office” where she appeared in more than 200 episodes as Angela Martin, the show brought her to the limelight. Angela has starred in more than 30 television shows and 15 movie roles in her career till now.</p><p>She has been able to garner a net worth of $ 12 million from all the roles she has played over the years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-her-husband></span><strong>Who is Her Husband?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Looking at her personal life, Angela Kinsey has been married twice. She first got married to Warren Lieberstein in June 2000. Warren is the brother of her “The Office” co-star Paul Lieberstein. She had the couple’s first child in May 2008 – a daughter named Isabella Ruby, but sadly by early 2009, Angela and Warren were separated from each other. In June 2010, she filed for divorce and cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason.</p><p>Angela is currently married to actor and YouTube pastry sensation, Joshua Snyder. It is believed that Angela and Joshua met each other through their children’s friendship which began in pre-school; Joshua has 2 sons – Jack and Cade, both from his first marriage to his ex-wife. Sometime in the early 2010s, Angela and Joshua moved into the same neighborhood, and as the friendship between Joshua’s sons and Angela’s daughter deepened, their parents began to see more of each other, and it blossomed into a romantic relationship soon after.</p><p>Angela Kinsey announced her engagement to Joshua Synder in August 2016, and 3 months later, they eventually got married after dating for a very long time. A month after the couple got married, they launched a YouTube channel called Baking with Josh & Ange, which showcases the excellent culinary skills of Joshua in particular – having learned how to cook from his grandmother. The channel has about 84,000 subscribers and is expected to grow in the coming months and years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35uw8eoZKKrXZa7qLHLmmSkoZ6osrp5xaumpmWknbJuu8WfoJydXay1sHnIrGStoJVitba%2FwZqlnWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./andraia-allsop.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andraia Allsop">&larr;
