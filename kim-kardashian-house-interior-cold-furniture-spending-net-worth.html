And whenever she shares details of her Hidden Hills house, which she bought in 2015 when she was still married to <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>, fans are totally fascinated by the way that she lives. <a href=#>Kim has a vegetable garden</a>, which is fun to see. But fans don't always like the design decisions that she makes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian posted a video</a> of how she did her house up for Christmas in November 2022, fans didn't agree with her decor choices, according to The New York Post. Kim said, “Look at how magical. In my bathroom, I always have plants out there, and there’s like a whole balcony and you can go through my shower [to] out there." Someone called it a "murder house" and many found it agree.</p><p>While not everyone agrees with Kim Kardashian's decor choices, she seems to love her house, which is full of neutral shades and doesn't include any bright colors. What expensive things does Kim Kardashian have in her home?</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-has-a-fridge-freezer-with-diamonds-on-it><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Has A Fridge/Freezer With Diamonds On It</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kim-instar.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People are always fascinated by what celebrities eat. <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian has followed the keto diet</a>. And Kim Kardashian loves the chopped salad from La Scala that features cucumbers, romaine lettuce, salami, mozzarella, artichoke heats, and sun-dried tomatoes.</p><p>While fans would expect the star to have an elegant and sophisticated kitchen, it turns out that it's a lot more over-the-top than people might think. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian has fancy kitchen appliances</a> that set her back quite a lot. According to The Daily Mail, she has a "Swarovski-encrusted fridge freezer."</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-has-four-gold-toilets-that-cost-750-000><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Has Four Gold Toilets That Cost $750,000</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kim-kardashian-on-kuwtk.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian seems to enjoy luxurious things. She always looks like she's dressed to the nines and she never has a hair out of place. So it's really no wonder that she owns gold toilets.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Pete Davidson's Girlfriend Chase Sui Wonders Really Feel About His Famous Exes Kim Kardashian And Ariana Grande?</a></span></p><p>And as one would expect, they didn't come cheap. According to The Daily Mail, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West bought four gold toilets that cost $750,000. Gold toilets are definitely subjective. While some might find them to be too much, others might think that they're super elegant.</p><h2 id=kanye-west-bought-a-600-000-couch-for-his-and-kim-kardashian-39-s-house><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kanye West Bought A $600,000 Couch For His And Kim Kardashian's House</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kim-kardashian-kanye-west.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Latch, Kanye West bought a couch by the brand Jean Royère Polar Bear for the house that he shared with Kim Kardashian. It cost $600,000, which is definitely more than most people are going to spend on a couch. And it's absolutely more than most would spend on all of their furniture, combined.</p><p>The Latch also mentioned that if someone wants to purchase a couch and two chairs from this company, it will cost $1 million. The couch fits into the neutral color palette that Kim favors for her house.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-actually-has-nine-different-fridges><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Actually Has Nine Different Fridges</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kim-kardashian-gray-outfit.jpg><p>While it's unknown how much she paid for each of them, the fact that Kim has nine fridges is definitely memorable. Considering her expensive taste and how much appliances can cost, she must have spent a fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to House Beautiful, Kim posted her fridges on her Instagram Stories, and fans were able to learn more about them. She has devoted three of the fridges to beverages. And one fridge is actually so big that it's a "walk-in fridge," which is pretty wild to see.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-spent-1-million-on-her-bed><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Spent $1 Million On Her Bed</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kim-kardashian-gym-outfit.jpg><p>According to Style Caster, Kim Kardashian paid $1 million for a bed by the brand Savoir Royal State.

This is definitely a style that Kim favors and now her fans can buy similar items. People reported in 2022 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim started a home decor line</a> called SKKN BY KIM. Kim said about it, "When designing this collection, I wanted to bring the monochromatic interior design elements from my home to others."</p><p>People reported that Kim bought pillows by the brand Murakami for her kids' area.
