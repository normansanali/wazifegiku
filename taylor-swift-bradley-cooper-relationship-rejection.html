From romantic escapades to breakups, Swift tells her stories in the most captivating words and rhythms. However, one story she did not seem to have sung about is <strong>her failed romance attempt with Hollywood star</strong><a href=# rel=nofollow><strong> Bradley Cooper.</strong></a> Over the years, Taylor Swift's love life publicly played out with 12 boyfriends, but Cooper, who was once her love interest, was not one of them.</p><p>Back in 2013, the 'Midnights" crooner was interested in brewing a romance with the "A Star is Born" actor, but things fell through right from inception. Bradley Cooper did not have a romantic interest in the "Wildest Dreams" singer. Therefore, that ship did not sail. It is safe to say that Taylor Swift has had more love experiences since then, enough for her to move past that moment, but what became of her rapport with Bradley Cooper after the longtime rejection? This article will explore where the two stars stand years after that interaction and why Cooper rejected Swift in the first place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-taylor-swift-and-bradley-cooper-39-s-relationship-today>Inside Taylor Swift And Bradley Cooper's Relationship Today</h2><p>It has been years since the<strong> romantic flop between Taylor Swift and Bradley Cooper</strong>, and the pair have had several relationships with other lovers' interests since then. <a href=# rel=nofollow>While Swift went on to date stars like Joe Alwyn, Harry Styles, and Matt Healy,</a> Cooper was romantically linked to Suki Waterhouse, Ren√©e Zellweger, and Irina Shayk at different points. Years after failing to bond over love, the lack of chemistry between Swift and Cooper did not deter them from moving in the same social circle.</p><p><strong>The pair spend time in each other's companies with their significant others</strong> and even go on double dates. In April 2024, Taylor Swift and her boyfriend Travis Kelce were in the news after enjoying a couples' vacation with Bradley Cooper and his girlfriend Gigi Hadid. The news got out when Travis Kecle's mom, Donna Kelce, revealed that her son and Swift were on a getaway at Carmel-by-the-sea in California. At QVC's Age of Possibility Summit, she said Kelce sent her a photo of their vacation with Cooper and Hadid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-7.jpg><p>Bradley Cooper and Taylor Swift move in the same Hollywood circle, and his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid, is Swift's longtime friend.

At the time, a 23-year-old Swift had recently gotten out of a relationship and was interested in the "American Sniper" actor. According to RadarOnline, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Swift enlisted Jennifer Lawrence to set up a date between her and Cooper.</a> At the time, there were rumors that Lawrence was involved with the actor due to their onscreen chemistry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-5.jpg><p>This was untrue because Jenifer Lawrence wasted no time playing a matchmaker between the stars. However, nothing came of it. According to a Bradley Cooper insider, <strong>the actor was not interested in Taylor Swift.</strong> The insider revealed, "First of all, her reputation precedes her. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bradley is very wary of dating someone who is a bit of a serial dater like Taylor."</a> The insider added:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He thinks she's far too young for him and wants to date someone his own age, not 16 years younger, because he's ready for something serious."</p><p>The source continued, revealing that the situation was "a little awkward" for Bradley Cooper when Jennifer Lawrence told him about Taylor Swift. They also made it known that the actor politely declined because he knew Lawrence and the "Bad Blood" singer were friends. After describing Swift's romantic interest in Cooper as "ambitious," the source noted that she would have to "fixate on someone else."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/all-of-taylor-swift-s-famous-exes-ranked-by-how-much-fans-loved-them-together-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="All Of Taylor Swift's Famous Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together">All Of Taylor Swift's Famous Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has dated celebrities like Harry Styles, John Mayer and Calvin Harris, and her fans have plenty of thoughts about each relationship.</p><p>Taylor Swift subconsciously took this advice because she definitely moved on with her love life. The star went on to date Calvin Harris two years later. Swift and the music producer met at the Elle Style Awards in 2015 after her friend and fellow singer, Elle Goulding, introduced them. They dated for 15 months. On the other hand, <strong>Bradley Cooper started dating Suki Waterhouse the same year he rejected Swift.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The duo were together for two years and had a very private relationship.
