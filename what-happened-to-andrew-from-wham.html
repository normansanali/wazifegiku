Wham! was a British pop sensation in the 1980s, known for hits like “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,” “Careless Whisper,” and “Last Christmas.” While George Michael was recognized for his vocal talent and charisma, Andrew played a significant role in the band’s image and songwriting. So, what happened to Andrew from Wham! after the band’s split in 1986?</p><h2 id=early-life-and-formation-of-wham-mKPpKEfkfN>Early Life and Formation of Wham!</h2><p>Andrew Ridgeley was born on January 26, 1963, in Windlesham, Surrey, England. He met George Michael at Bushey Meads School, and they formed a fast friendship over a shared love of music. This bond led to the creation of Wham! in 1981. The duo quickly rose to fame with their catchy tunes and vibrant music videos.</p><h2 id=the-success-of-wham-mKPpKEfkfN>The Success of Wham!</h2><p>Wham! became one of the most popular musical acts of the 80s, with a string of chart-topping hits. Andrew’s role in the band was often seen as the instrumentalist and backing vocalist, complementing George’s lead vocals.

Andrew, on the other hand, took a different path.</p><h2 id=andrew-ridgeleys-solo-career-mKPpKEfkfN>Andrew Ridgeley’s Solo Career</h2><p>After the split, Andrew released a solo album, “Son of Albert,” in 1990.
