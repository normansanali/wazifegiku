He was born on 17 May, 1940. His current age is 81 years old as of 2021.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=peter-gerety-net-worth></span>Peter Gerety Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Peter Gerety has made a huge net worth from his acting career. He has been in the industry for a number of decades now. He has appeared in a number of films and television shows. Among them include; K-Pax, People I Know and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion.</p><p>He has also appeared in Hollywood Ending, Wolf, Charlie Wilson’s War, Surviving Picasso, War of the Worlds, Things That Hang from Trees, Inside Man, and Changeling.

In 2013, he played the role of John Cotter in Nora Ephron’s Broadway play Lucky Guy with Tom Hanks.</p><p>Peter Gerety has an estimated net worth of $2 million. Gerety summoned his fortune from his successful career as an actor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=peter-gerety-wife-anne-gerety></span>Peter Gerety Wife | Anne Gerety<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At 79, Peter Gerety still maintains his secret of a personal life. He has never at any one time disclosed details about his wife. We are not sure whether he is married or not. He notably takes burly, thickset, and occasionally scruffy character roles with a domineering and imposing presence.</p><p>He often accepts roles as ordinary working-class stiffs, judges, or inner-city law officers. That perhaps seems perfect but not as for his personal life. We can however guess that he is probably married with a family.</p><p>Anne Gerety is the mother to Peter Gerety. She passed on on 25th October, 2003.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=peter-gerety-movies></span>Peter Gerety Movies<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>The Good Wife (2010) as Judge Timothy Stanek</li><li>Rubicon (2010) as David Hadas</li><li>Prime Suspect (2011) as Desmond Timoney</li><li>Get the Gringo (2012) as Embassy Guy</li></ul><ul><li>Flight (2012) as Avington Carr</li><li>Muhammad Ali’s Greatest Fight (2013) as William Brennan</li><li>God’s Pocket (2014) as McKenna</li><li>Cymbeline (2014) as Dr. Cornelius</li></ul><ul><li>A Case of Deadly Force (1986) as Bobby Doyle</li><li>Ollie Hopnoodle’s Haven of Bliss (1988) as Gertz</li><li>The Kennedys of Massachusetts (1990) as Irish Driver</li><li>K-PAX (2001) as Sal</li></ul><ul><li>Hollywood Ending (2002) as Psychiatrist</li><li>Ash Wednesday (2002) as Uncle Handy</li><li>Second Best (2004) as Marshall</li><li>Looking for Kitty (2004) as Gus Maplethorpe</li></ul><ul><li>Indocumentados (2004) as O’Brien</li><li>Runaway (2005) as Mo</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=peter-gerety-health></span>Peter Gerety Health<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Slowly approaching 80, Peter Gerety seems to be in perfect health. Even at the prime of his age, he has recently appeared in movies and television shows. His health has not yet weighed on him. He is energetic. You should not be surprised if you see him in another new show! He loves his talent and career and until he officially resigns, we think he should push on.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=peter-gerety-news></span>Peter Gerety News<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The central role of Marius, the con man who adopts the identity of “Pete” for his long con, is played by Giovanni Ribisi, probably best known for his film work, and he essentially gives Marius a character arc that’s barely suggested on the page.</p><p>That arc is, “Marius gets too close to the family he’s conning,” a story you’ve heard before, but Ribisi sells both Marius’s guilt and his inability to resist the allure of a really great con in equal measure. The family itself is stacked with talent. Margo Martindale (of Justified and The Americans and everything) is the matriarch, with Peter Gerety (of The Wire, among many others) as her husband, who’s lost a step after a stroke.</p><p>Marin Ireland — she was one of the most memorable terrorists on Homeland — plays their granddaughter, who is being primed to take over the family business. (There are two other grandchildren, played by less recognizable faces Shane McRae and Libe Barer, but both are solid.)</p><p>Even many of the smaller roles feature recognizable faces. Bryan Cranston himself plays the season’s main villain, and he appears in far more of the show than you’d expect, given his thriving film career. Alison Wright (Martha on The Americans) drops by occasionally as an old con friend of Marius’s.</p><p>And so, so, so many Justified cast members turn up in parts large and small, including Jacob Pitts as Ireland’s character’s ex and Brad William Henke as a decent dude whose life intersects with Marius.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=peter-gerety-contacts></span>Peter Gerety Contacts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Instagram</strong></li><li><strong>Twitter</strong></li><li><strong>Facebook</strong></li><li><strong>Youtube</strong></li><li><strong>Tiktok</strong></li><li><strong>Website</strong></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=related-biographies></span>Related Biographies<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You may also like to read the <strong>Bio</strong>, <strong>Career</strong>, <strong>Family</strong>, <strong>Relationship, </strong><strong>Body measurements</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Net worth</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Achievements,</strong>&nbsp;and more about:</p><ul><li><strong>Peter Scolari&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Peter Krause</strong></li><li><strong>Peter Billingsley</strong></li><li><strong>Peter Facinelli</strong></li><li><strong>Peter Dinklage</strong></li><li><strong>Peter MacNicol</strong></li><li><strong>Peter Browngardt</strong></li><li><strong>Peter Cambor NCIS</strong></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKiVqbKzecaeqZ6sqWKvqrvGq5ipoKlirqixjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIywoJ%2BdXaK8t7XErGShnZGhwal5zZ6urGVjZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rupert-grint-had-trouble-kissing-emma-watson-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rupert Grint Had Trouble Kissing Emma Watson for Adorable Reasons That We Will Push Aside for the Sa">&larr;
