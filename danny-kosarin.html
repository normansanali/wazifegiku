Kosarin is also popular as the father of famous American actress and singer <a href=#><strong>Kira Kosarin</strong></a>. Danny has already produced a dozen of movies which are doing really good in the box office.&nbsp;</p><p>Danny Kosarin is very low-key when it comes to his personal details, so till date, nobody knows about his birth date, birthplace. Yet, Kosarin holds American nationality and belongs to white ethnicity.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though there are no details on Danny, his daughter Kira was born in 1997 and celebrated her birthday on October 07. In the same way, his daughter graduated from Pine Crest School as she used to do dancing and gymnastics in her early years.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/8/25/Capture%20(2)-1566715561090.jpg><p>Danny first stole the limelight after appearing in a number of movies as an actor. Kosarin has appeared in <i>Scared Sweet</i> (2012), <i>Pow Wham Night Wild</i> (2015) and <i>Cartwheels and Backflips</i> (2015). The movies he has appeared in have done really good in the field of the box office.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting inspired by their father, his daughter Kira also laid her hands in the field of the entertainment industry. Not only that, but Kira is also a popular singer and songwriter and owns her own <i>Youtube</i> channel.&nbsp;</p><h2>Personal Life: Wife</h2><p>Danny is a married man. He tied a knot to his long term girlfriend, <strong>Lauren Kosarin, </strong>in the presence of their close friends and family. As said before, Danny is very low-key when it comes to his personal life, so there is barely any information about his wedding date and other details about his marriage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/8/25/Capture%20(1)-1566715528415.jpg><p>Danny is an active social media user so we can see, him often posting a picture of his wife and daughter on the Instagram page. Recently, a week back, Danny posted a picture with his wife Lauren and captioned it&nbsp;</p><p>Me and my love (also known as Kiraâ€™s mom) in South Africa</p><p>For sure, Danny is not shy to shower his love to his wife in any circumstances. That is the reason why despite being married for more than two decades, the couple still is inseparable.&nbsp;</p><h3>Children&nbsp;</h3><p>As mentioned above, Danny is the father of a daughter. Kosarin shares only one child with his wife.</p><p>His daughter also dated a few guys, but as for now, she is living a single life. The actress and singer dated <a href=#><strong>Nick Merico</strong></a> but their relationship couldn't last long and soon broke up with each other.</p><p>While the reason for their breakup is still unavailable, some of the fans speculated Kira had an affair with <a href=#><strong>Chase Austin</strong></a>. Yet the speculation was never verified.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary&nbsp;</h2><p>Danny has surely pocketed a huge amount of money from his film producing and acting career. However, there is no information about his net worth and salary. On the other hand, his daughter, Kira Kosarin's net worth is estimated to be around <strong>$1 million</strong>. Also, her annual salary is about <strong>$100,000</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/8/25/Capture%20(3)-1566715599069.jpg><p>Similarly, actors like Kira make about <strong>$45</strong> an hour as per the report. Similarly, Kira also has a YouTube channel with more than 2k subscribers and is estimated to have about <strong>$10.8 thousand</strong> of her annual channel revenue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp2Yp6apYriwv8CroKc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./drake-tester-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-182812-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Drake Tester Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography ">&larr;
