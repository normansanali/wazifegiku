The film follows a down on his luck, ex-reporter named Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) as he scrambles to get his life together after being dumped by his fiancé and fired from his job. However, things take an unexpected turn as he is called to covertly investigate a multimillion-dollar science tech company running illegal experiments on humans. As he does this, Eddie becomes infected by the alien symbiote Venom whom he must host within his body. Eventually, the pair find a working rhythm in order to co-exist within the vessel of Eddie’s body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tom Holland's Spider-Man Will Clash With Tom Hardy's Venom, Some Day</a></span></p><p>With the second installment of the series Venom: Let There be Carnage having been released in 2021, the franchise continues to <a href=#>introduce familiar Hollywood faces</a> into the world of Marvel. But whose net worth ranks the highest?</p><h2 id=reid-scott---1-7-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Reid Scott - $1.7 Million</span></h2><p>https://mobile.twitter.com/mrreidscott</p><p>Coming in at number 8 we have Reid Scott. Despite his minor role in the first Venom film, it seems as though his character of Dr. Dan Lewis, is a recurring one as he also appears in Venom: Let there Be Carnage. However, before the comic series first landed on our screens, this critically acclaimed actor was known for his role as Dan Egan in the Emmy-winning series Veep. He also starred as Brendan “Brando” Dorff in the hit TBS Sitcom My Boys. According to Idol Networth, his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth comes in at $1.7 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=riz-ahmed---3-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Riz Ahmed - $3 Million</span></h2><p>www.instagram.com/p/COSw5ROFn8l/</p><p>UK-born actor and rapper Riz Ahmed is an undeniable powerhouse of talent and creativity. With an impressive array of accolades under his belt, this Academy Award-nominated actor comes in at number 7 on this list, with a modest <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3 million net worth</a> as reported by Celebrity Net Worths. Ahmed formed part of the cast for the first Venom film and he portrayed the film’s villain, Carlton Drake, a power-hungry entrepreneur with an askew moral compass.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What To Expect From Venom 2</a></span></p><h2 id=naomie-harris---4-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Naomie Harris - $4 Million</span></h2><p>www.instagram.com/p/CUV1AD4hw71/</p><p>At number 6 on the list, we have Naomie Harris. 45-year-old Harris portrayed the character of Frances Barrison also known as Shriek in Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Outside of the Venom universe, Harris has acquired multiple roles in different projects with critical acclaim. For example, she portrayed the role of Paula in the Academy Award-winning Moonlight and even made appearances in multiple Bond films such as Skyfall, Spectre, and the latest installment No Time To Die. Her net worth is reported to come in at $4 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stephen-graham---5-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Stephen Graham - $5 Million</span></h2><p>www.instagram.com/p/CU2qKgPtYjs/</p><p>In fifth place, we have English actor, Stephen Graham. Graham debuted his role as Detective Mulligan in the series in 2021 during the second installment. Prior to his involvement in Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Graham had been an established actor with several acting credits within film and television dating back to 1990. His most iconic role was in 2006 when he portrayed the character of Combo in the British feature This Is England. Graham received a British Independent Film Award for his work as a supporting actor in the feature. More recently Graham has been a part of various A-list projects such as the 2019 biopic Rocketman and Netflix’s star-studded crime drama The Irishman. His net worth is reported to come in at $5 million.</p><h2 id=jenny-slate---6-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jenny Slate - $6 Million</span></h2><p>www.instagram.com/p/CH_FW8xlRAN/</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taking the fourth spot and just missing out on a spot on the Venom top-three podium is Big Mouth star, Jenny Slate. Slate portrayed the character of Dora Skirth, a quick and intelligent researcher who met her demise due to her betrayal of the film’s villain in the first installment of the series. Before her role in Venom, Slate portrayed a supporting role in the 2017 emotional drama Gifted alongside fellow Marvel alum, Chris Evans. Her net worth reportedly comes in at $6 Million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Details About Venom The Movie Didn't Show Us</a></span></p><h2 id=michelle-williams---30-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Michelle Williams - $30 Million</span></h2><p>www.instagram.com/p/CUC8s9hNina/</p><p>With an impressive net worth of $30 million, Venom’s leading lady Michelle Williams takes the title of the third-richest cast member. In both the first and second installments, she portrays the role of Anne Weying, Eddie Brock’s ex-fiancé and current partner to Dr. Dan Lewis. Much like her character, Williams is talented and incredibly hardworking as reflected in her two Golden Globe Awards and impressive four Academy Award nominations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-hardy---45-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tom Hardy - $45 Million</span></h2><p>www.instagram.com/p/BqF8ax9g4k6/</p><p>In second place on the list is the film series’<a href=#> leading man, Tom Hardy.</a> Hardy not only portrays the iconic Eddie Brock but also voices the role of his living partner, alien symbiote Venom. Hardy is known for his “tough guy” roles in both film and television, for example, his iconic role as both legendary gangsters and brothers Reggie and Ronnie Kray in the 2015 film Legend and his role in Netflix’s Peaky Blinders. His net worth comes in at an impressive $45 million.</p><h2 id=woody-harrelson---70-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Woody Harrelson - $70 Million</span></h2><p>www.instagram.com/p/B04Wo-EAzxy/</p><p>And finally, taking the crown and first place on this list is Venom: Let There Be Carnage’s villain, Woody Harrelson. The first place spot may come as no surprise to many as Harrelson continues to be one of Hollywood’s most recognizable talents. Harrelson rose to fame due to his breakout role as Woody Boyd in NBC’s 1985 sitcom Cheers. The three-time Academy Award-nominated actor reportedly comes in at a whopping $70 million net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's How Spiderman Will Leave The MCU And Join Venom</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopuYmsC1ecCcq6iqXZu%2FsLmMr5ynp51iurDCyJ6qZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./blake-lively-apologizes-for-betty-buzz-ad-mocking-kate-middleton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Blake Lively Apologizes for Betty Buzz Ad Mocking Kate Middleton">&larr;
