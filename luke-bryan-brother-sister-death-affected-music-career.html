And although Bryan's early years were typical, he aspired to make it big in Nashville. His dream was partially encouraged by his mother, who nurtured and coached his innate signing abilities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar51208356-1.jpg><p>As Luke Bryan got older, he would perform solo and with his band at small venues and local pubs using the guitar his parents had purchased for him. Not long after he graduated from high school, Bryan made plans to move to Nashville to further his country music career. But just as he was on the verge of stardom, <strong>his brother, Chris, tragically died in a car accident</strong>.</p><p>According to a report in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail, Luke Bryan</a> sat down on the Today Show in 2017, where <strong>he briefly discussed the heartbreak</strong> he and his family endured after losing his older brother.</p><p>When Chris passed away I was 19 years old, fixin' to chase my dream. It just totally rocked our family's world, rocked my world...It makes you appreciate chasing dreams, you know. You're like, Hey you get one go-round at this thing called life and it's very fragile, so you better go after your dreams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the passing of his brother, <strong>Bryan decided to throw himself into his music </strong>while remaining close at home to his family.</p><p>He later attended <strong>Georgia Southern University</strong>, and after graduation, he worked full-time for his father.</p><p>However, a year later, <strong>Bryan fulfilled his dream at his father's insistence and moved to Nashville</strong>, where he was eventually signed to Capitol Nashville.</p><h2 id=luke-bryan-suffered-another-tragedy-in-his-life-when-two-more-family-members-passed-away>Luke Bryan Suffered Another Tragedy In His Life When Two More Family Members Passed Away</h2><p>Unfortunately, country singer <strong>Luke Bryan's brother Chris' passing </strong>wouldn't be the last time he would experience a devastating tragedy.</p><p>In 2007, <strong>Bryan's last remaining sibling, his older sister Kelly, died</strong> from an undisclosed cause.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52164034-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several years after her passing, Bryan talked to People Magazine about the sudden departure of his sister:</p><p>They never determined what happened. The autopsies, the coroner, no one could figure it out.</p><p>In addition to Bryan's statement, his wife Caroline, speaking to CMT, said that her late sister-in-law was: "healthy, beautiful, and the best mom ever to walk this earth."</p><p>If losing his sister wasn't bad enough, seven years later, the latter's husband, <strong>Ben Lee Chesire, d*ed from a heart attack.</strong></p><p>In a selfless act and in honor of his sister and brother-in-law, <strong>Bryan and his wife took in and began raising the Cheshire's three children</strong>.</p><p>Luke Bryan told the Sun magazine:</p><p>Now we have three children that have lost both their parents, so that becomes our new focus, to try to navigate and guide them through this life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Years after the tragedy, Bryan spoke to Billboard magazine about how the rest of his family was coping:</p><p>It forever altered my mother's belief systems. I'll get random calls from her when she's having bad days. One day, she's missing my brother, one day, she's missing my sister, and one day, she wants to be around me more, because I'm all she's got left. We give Mama the benefit of the doubt on stuff.
