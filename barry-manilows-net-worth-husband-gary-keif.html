According to the actress, Kief was vital to Manilow's sanity and ultimate longevity. "There's Barry Manilow the performer, and then there's the Barry 'machine.' It takes enormous savvy and know-how to book and market complicated arena tours, choreograph promotion, direct the entire team and make it look effortless, and that part is Garry's domain.
