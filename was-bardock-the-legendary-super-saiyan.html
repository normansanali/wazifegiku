It would blow his mind and the fact that it was Goku's father.</span></span><h2>Is Bardock technically the first Super Saiyan?</h2>Bardock is the first super saiyan, frieza didn't destroy him he nearly sent him back in time. Which is where bardock continued to live his life as the present. There he was able to reach the super saiyan level.<h2>Was Bardock the strongest Saiyan?</h2>bardock was the strongest saiyan when the planet exploded, unless youn include broly, however broly is not canon as the movies are not considered canon. bardock the father of goku was a special, not a movie and was considered canon by akira toriyama, so much so that he put bardock in the updated manga.<h2>What is the legendary Super Saiyan called?</h2>Legendary Super Saiyan (伝説の超サイヤ人 Densetsu no Sūpā Saiya-jin) is a Super Saiyan transformation unique to the Legendary Saiyan, who is born every one thousand years. The form is far different from the other Super Saiyan transformations. The fourth and latest Legendary Super Saiyan is Broly.<h2>Can Bardock go Super Saiyan God?</h2>Bardock's popularity saw to the release of a second special starring the character. Though even more outside of the canon than the non-canon specials, it did allow Bardock to go Super Saiyan.<h2>WHO IS THE LEGENDARY SUPER SAIYAN? | A Dragonball Discussion</h2><p></p><h2>What is Bardock's strongest form?</h2>Because of this, Bardock has gained access to a plethora of forms and power boosts that no average Saiyan would ever come into contact with, one of these being the legendary Super Saiyan 3 transformation. This form is so powerful it may even hold the power to destroy Beerus and the Gods of Destruction completely.<h2>What if Bardock went SS?</h2>He couldn't because the Super Saiyan transformation only multiplies power 50X. Bardock's power level is 10,000. 50 X 10,000 would be 500,000. Even in his first form, Frieza's power level is 530,000, meaning Bardock would be beaten by great margin even if Frieza didn't transform.<h2>Who was the first Legendary Super Saiyan?</h2>Vegeta in "Super Saiyan?" Yamoshi (ヤモシ, Yamoshi) is an ancient Saiyan who could transform into a Super Saiyan long before Goku could. After his death, his spirit wandered in search of six pure-hearted Saiyans, to create the ceremony that would birth the first Super Saiyan God.<h2>What is Kales Super Saiyan form?</h2>Kale achieved this form after gaining complete control of her Berserker form's power, resulted her in achieving the True Legendary Super Saiyan form. This form has comparable power to a Super Saiyan God and is much more powerful than her Berserk form.<h2>Is Broly the true Legendary Super Saiyan?</h2>The Super Saiyan of the legend is the Original Super Saiyan that appeared on the original Saiyan homeworld a thousand years prior. The Legendary Super Saiyan is Broly, that had a genetic mutation that made him too powerful. Bardock is a Super Saiyan only in the Dragon Ball Heroes special for the game.<h2>Is Bardock elite?</h2>Team Bardock, also known as Bardock's "Five-Person Land-Shark Team", Bardock's planet elite force, or simply Bardock's Elite, is a crew of low-class Saiyan soldiers led by Bardock under the Saiyan Army.<h2>How strong is Bardock now?</h2>During this time, presiding doctors attest that Bardock's power level is approaching 10,000, and that at this rate he may surpass the strength of the Saiyan monarch, King Vegeta.<h2>Is Bardock stronger than gas?</h2>After so many months of building up the mystery behind why Bardock was able to defeat Gas, a being that was seemingly far stronger than he was with his power level being at around ten thousand at the time, pulling a win out of thin air doesn't give Goku and company much information to rely on in their fight in the ...<h2>Is Yamoshi Broly?</h2>You guys probably remember the image of Yamoshi from the ritual and legends shown in Battle of gods and say "That looked nothing like Broly. That looked more like Vegeta." You would be correct, but the truth is, that was just a representation of him. He was a recycled character model.<h2>Who was the first Super Saiyan 4?</h2>The Super Saiyan 4 form is first achieved by Goku in Dragon Ball GT after transforming into a Golden Great Ape and witnessing his granddaughter Pan crying to calm him down.<h2>Was Bardock a brilliant scientist?</h2>In the Broly Abridged movie, both Paragus and Vegeta refer to Bardock as a brilliant scientist, implying that he actually is a scientist in the Team Four Star continuity, (then again he is apparently smarter than the average Saiyan warrior).<h2>Is Kale a legendary SS?</h2>Kale is Caulifla's best friend, sister-figure, and protégée. She is the latest Legendary Saiyan of Universe 6, a demon warrior who appears once every 1,000 years.<h2>Is Kale related to Broly?</h2>Ok, it has now been confirmed. Kale is the legendary super sayains of U6. So she is the U6 Broly. Episode 114 preview confirmed it, from Goku's mouth.<h2>Who is stronger Kale or Broly?</h2>Broly is far too many leagues of power above Kale to make it an even match. If Broly's fighting style wasn't all about powering through his opponents' attacks, Kale would never even touch the man. She would probably stand more of a chance after fusing with Caulifla, but that goes against the spirit of the comparison.<h2>Is Yamoshi a Bardock?</h2>Yamoshi is actually Bardock : r/dragonball.<h2>Who went Super Saiyan blue first?</h2>9 It First Appeared In The Anime<p>Goku and Vegeta!", Vegeta breaks his own limits when he remembers his promise to Cabba. Vegeta breaking through his limits is not unlike Goku when he achieved Ultra Instinct.</p><h2>Is Goku a Yamoshi?</h2>Here's everything that's known about this mysterious figure. The first person to access the Super Saiyan form in the Dragon Ball universe wasn't Goku – it was a man named Yamoshi.<h2>How close was Bardock to becoming a Super Saiyan?</h2>Bardock, like most of the Saiyans who were alive at the time of Frieza's attack on Planet Vegeta, was nowhere near powerful enough to become a Super Saiyan. It takes an extraordinary amount of power to achieve that state, and it requires immense training and great discipline.<h2>Does Bardock meet Goku?</h2>The life of Bardock was recently explored in the anime via the latest film in the Shonen franchise, Dragon Ball Super: Broly, with the movie taking a moment to show Bardock and Gine sending a young Goku into the stratosphere to escape Freeza's attack and the destruction of the Planet Vegeta.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9aaqmaakaexsK%2FKZquhnV2hsqixzZ2Yq7FdqMKxsdFmqpqhqZa7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-james-camerons-net-worth-in-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is James Cameron's net worth in 2024?">&larr;
