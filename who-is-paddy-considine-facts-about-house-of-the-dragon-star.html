The recent HBO series, which serves as the prequel to the popular Game of Thrones, takes its viewers 200 years before the events on GoT and chronicles the beginning of the downfall of House Targaryen. It stars Paddy Considine as the "warm, kind, and decent man" of King Viserys I, Matt Smith as Prince Daemon, Emma D'Arcy, Olivia Cooke, Rhys Ifans, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is House Of The Dragon Living Up To Game Of Thrones' Success So Far?</a></span></p><p>There's still a lot to tell about the life and the decade-long career that its star, Paddy Considine, has. Before House of the Dragon, the English actor has been a familiar face on British television, starring in the likes of Peaky Blinders, The Outsider, Informer, and more. To sum it up, here's a look at the life and the career of Paddy Considine, one of the most prominent English TV actors, and what other films or series we may have seen him in.</p><h2 id=paddy-considine-has-appeared-in-several-music-videos><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Paddy Considine Has Appeared In Several Music Videos</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born in Staffordshire in the West Midlands of England, Paddy Considine graduated from Burton College where he obtained a National Diploma in Performing Arts and met his longtime collaborator, Shane Meadows. Before venturing into films, they formed a band called short-lived She Talks to Angels with Nick Hemming and more.</p><p>It didn't last long, especially as Paddy moved to Brighton to study photography at the university, but he continued to hone his musical talent by forming another band with a Britpop sound, Pedestrians, and a rock band called Riding the Low. He also appears in several music videos for some of the biggest names in English music, like Coldplay's "God Put a Smile upon Your Face," Moloko's "Familiar Feeling," and Arctic Monkeys' "Leave Before the Lights Come On."</p><h2 id=paddy-considine-39-s-wife><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Paddy Considine's Wife</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paddy Considine still resides in the city where he was born in and always keeps his private business on the down low. He met his longtime sweetheart, Shelley Insley, when he was 18 and has been in a relationship since then. They tied the knot in 2002 and lives together with their three children.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I wanted to be married, wanted to be a father</a>.

The film centers around the life of a man, who's on the verge of collapse, as he seeks to redeem himself and restore the good life that he once had.</p><p>A few years after its premiere, Dog Altogether's storyline was expanded into Paddy's film-feature debut, Tyrannosaur.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is House Of The Dragon Not So Secretly Doomed To Fail Harder Than Game Of Thrones?</a></span></p><h2 id=paddy-considine-also-has-a-cameo-appearance-in-peaky-blinders><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Paddy Considine Also Has A Cameo Appearance In Peaky Blinders</span></h2><p>In the third season of Peaky Blinders, Paddy Considine had a recurring role as Father Hughes in four episodes.

He shares bad blood with Thomas Shelby, but the latter is forced to work for him to protect his family and friends before Michael Gray takes his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paddy-considine-received-a-tony-award-nomination><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Paddy Considine Received A Tony Award Nomination</span></h2><p>The Third Day actor may have little-to-no experience as a stage actor, despite portraying Banquo in Shakespear's Macbeth in 2015. However, Paddy Considine did receive nominations for Best Actor from Olivier Awards and Tony for his polarizing performance in The Ferryman in 2018 and 2019. The play itself ended up winning the Best Play at the 73rd annual Tony Awards in the latter year.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What The Cast Of 'Game Of Thrones' Is Up To Now</a></span></p><h2 id=paddy-considine-once-co-starred-jason-statham-in-blitz><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Paddy Considine Once Co-Starred Jason Statham In Blitz</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, the actor shared the stage with Jason Statham in Blitz.
