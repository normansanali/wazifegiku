Now known better as Amal Clooney, she is a successful lawyer and writer, perhaps most renowned for working at the “Doughty Street Chambers”, and representing such celebrities as Yulia Tymoshenko and Julian Assange. Recently Amal became even more recognized as she married the famous actor, George Clooney. However, Alamuddin is an acclaimed lawyer and has earned the acclaim of others. As she is still quite young, there is little doubt that her career will become even more successful.</p><p>So how rich is Amal Alamuddin? It is estimated that Amal’s net worth is about $10 million. Of course, if her husband’s net worth is added to this sum, the number would be a lot higher as his estimated net worth is more than $100 million. Despite this fact, Amal is clearly an independent woman who can take care of herself. The main source of her net worth is her career as a lawyer, but her other activities also add a lot to this sum.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=amal-alamuddin-net-worth-10-million></span>Amal Alamuddin Net Worth $10 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Amal grew up in a wealthy family, as her father was the owner of the successful travel agency “COMET”. In addition to this, Amal’s mother also had her own company, called “International Communication Experts”. It can be said that from a very young age Amal saw that you need to work hard in order to achieve something and this, of course, influenced her own decisions in life. The family moved to the UK in the early 1980s, shortly after the start of the Lebanese civil war, and Alamuddin studied at Dr. Challoner’s High School and later continued her studies at St. Hugh’s College, Oxford, graduating with a degree in Jurisprudence. After some time she started attending the New York University School of Law, graduating with a Master’s degree in Law, where she was able to gain more knowledge and experience in law. During her studies she also started working at the United States Court of Appeals and later at the International Court of Justice. When Amal finished her studies, she received an invitation to work at the company called “Sullivan & Cromwell”. This had a huge impact on the growth of Amal Alamuddin’s net worth.</p><p>In addition to this, Amal had an opportunity to work at such institutions as “International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia” and “Special Tribunal for Lebanon”. In 2010 Amal started working at the “Doughty Street Chambers” and this added a lot to her net worth. Step by step Amal became more and more acclaimed as a lawyer, and gained a lot of respect from others. In addition to this, Amal also lectured at several institutions: SOAS, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Columbia Law School and others. What is more, Amal has written numerous articles, including “The Anatomy of an Unfair Trial”, “Expanding Jurisdiction Over War Crimes Under Article 8 of the ICC Statute”, “Will Syria go to the ICC?”, and others. These works also made Amal’s net worth higher, and added to her reputation and popularity.</p><p>If to talk about Amal’s personal life, in 2014 she married star actor George Clooney. All in all, Amal Alamuddin is a very successful, intelligent and beautiful woman, who has achieved a lot. She is a respected lawyer, who is famous in various countries as she has worked with important people from different parts of the world. Only hard work and determination helped her to achieve acclaim.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Amal Clooney</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 3, 1978</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Beirut, Lebanon</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>A British-Lebanese lawyer, activist, and author</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>New York University School of Law, Dr Challoner’s High School at Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, St Hugh’s College, Oxford</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British and Lebanese</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>George Clooney(m. 2014)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Baria Alamuddin, Ramzi Alamuddin,</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Tala Alamuddin, Ziad Alamuddin, Samer Alamuddin</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm5007802</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>An Exhibition and the Shrigley Award at St. Hugh’s College, Jack J.
