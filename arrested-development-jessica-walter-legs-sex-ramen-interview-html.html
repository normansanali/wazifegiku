If you have not already watched all fifteen episodes, please come back later. </i>If Lucille Bluth was only going to star in one episode of the new season, at least it was an episode jam-packed with sex, lies, and buffoonery. And singing! And Lucille 2! And Kristen Wiig as young Lucille! In the series’$2 2006 finale, the Bluth family’s boozy matriarch (and <a href=#>head winker</a>) attempted to flee from the SEC. In this season, she is placed under house arrest, sent to a fancy jail, is adopted into the Jade Dragon Triad, checks into rehab, gets cast in a musical, and — shockingly — decides to call it quits with George Sr. Jessica Walter talked to Vulture about the future of her onscreen marriage, binge-watching the new season, and loving all the crazy shit <i>Arrested Development </i>boss Mitch Hurwitz throws at her.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bcdb0fecb9833b35cfd706be22a53157-3-0-0@published data-word-count=22><b>Have you seen all the episodes already?<br></b>I did.

We had guests in our country house. Of course, we had to get to episode ten [Lucille’s chapter in the series]. We were a little blotto by then [<i>laughs</i>]. But it was great. We did take breaks in between. Then on Memorial Day, we watched the remaining five. We just had to! And in our country house we have a huge big screen, and it was fun to see it there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bcdb0fecb9833b35cfd706be22a53157-5-0-0@published data-word-count=41><b>The whole series opens with Kristen Wiig playing young Lucille.

I thought she was spot-on terrific.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bcdb0fecb9833b35cfd706be22a53157-6-0-0@published data-word-count=54><b>She really nailed all the things your eyes do.<br></b>I feel like I’m not even aware of that!

I swim four to five times a week in a 75-foot pool and that must be it. I’ve been swimming since 1976. Plus, if you live in New York you do a lot of walking. I’m just very active.

And yet she’s still controlling the entire family from wherever she’s being held.<br></b>You know, Lucille is the most manipulative character in the family. In order to preserve her fast-fading lifestyle she’s gotta wheel and deal, and the machinations that occur are usually masterminded by her. I like to think of her as smarter than some of them. I’m not going to say who.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bcdb0fecb9833b35cfd706be22a53157-10-0-0@published data-word-count=9><b>Well, she works everyone.<br></b>She knows how to hondle.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bcdb0fecb9833b35cfd706be22a53157-11-0-0@published data-word-count=68><b>Is there a full version of Lucille’s villain song?<br></b>That was it. Mitch wrote that one piece. The whole point is Lucille’s not supposed to be a great singer but she just wants to get into the show so she can get on the boat and escape.

I was just on his show the other night with Elisabeth Moss — she’s so beautiful, you could die. And actually, I met Andy Cohen when I was on with the other Andy, Anderson Cooper. I was a guest on his show and Andy Cohen was his co-host, so I had the two Andys at the same time. I love them both. But to your question, I don’t watch the <i>Housewives</i>. Now you tell me. What did you think of the season? You can be honest.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bcdb0fecb9833b35cfd706be22a53157-14-0-0@published data-word-count=70><b>I loved it. <a href=#>Most critics were pretty positive</a>.

My own review is I thought we did a really good job, and Mitch did a brilliant job wrangling the whole thing together.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bcdb0fecb9833b35cfd706be22a53157-15-0-0@published data-word-count=125><b>The process sounded <a href=#>complicated</a>!

We shot totally out of order, so sometimes you’d be saying things and you didn’t know why you were saying them. And then later on, when another script would come in, “Oh, <i>that’s</i> why I was saying that!” It was very challenging and an interesting way to work. I had felt from the beginning that I would either be really, really lousy or okay. Hopefully I was okay! But I’ll tell you, when we were shooting, everyone and everything fell right back into place. I especially felt that way about my relationship with Buster. Isn’t he wonderful?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bcdb0fecb9833b35cfd706be22a53157-16-0-0@published data-word-count=48><b>Tony Hale said the smoking scene was very <a href=#>rough on his lungs</a>.<br></b>I know, I know.
