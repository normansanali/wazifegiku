Sure, she’s been busy lately with The Morning Show, <a href=#>her highly successful (and lucrative) series for Apple TV+</a> with Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon. But away from the cameras, Aniston has also become one successful entrepreneur.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While her best pal <a href=#>Courteney Cox has a line of home cleaning products</a>, the Emmy winner has her very own haircare brand, LolaVie. And now, to celebrate its first anniversary, Aniston recently introduced two new products that customers have been asking about for quite some time.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-started-lolavie-because-she-still-had-a-lsquo-serious-bug-for-this-industry-rsquo>Jennifer Aniston Started LolaVie Because She Still Had A ‘Serious Bug For This Industry’</h2><p>One might say that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aniston’s involvement with the haircare industry started out of necessity</a>.</p><p>“I had really troublesome hair, and always had to deal with it,” the actress explained.</p><p>And so, she decided to work with various brands, collaborating with them “as an actor for hire with minimal investment.” Among them was a partnership with Living Proof, where she served as both an ambassador and product creator.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I had a certain amount of involvement creatively,” Aniston explained of her previous work with Living Proof. “I wanted to be brought behind the curtain, into the lab and understand the science — how you can take these ingredients and shampoos that are damaging the hair, ultimately, and replace them with some new molecule that will enhance the health of your hair.”</p><p>She added, “I’m not just a name on a product — I have a financial investment, I have emotional investment, and creative investment.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Will 'The Morning Show' End After Season 2?</a></span></p><p>When Living Proof was sold to Unilever in 2016, however, Aniston exited that partnership. But then, even after that, the business kept drawing her back in.</p><p>“When that partnership came to a close, I still had a serious bug for this industry,” the actress explained. “I still had more to do, and more ideas, and more products that I wanted to create.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And that’s how Aniston ended up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">launching LolaVie in 2021</a>, which took some time to get right. “We've been in development for almost five years,” she revealed.</p><p>The actress also didn’t mind spending this much time before launching the brand because she personally takes hair care very seriously.</p><p>“I think our hair is a big part of our expression - of how we feel. You have a good hair day and you have a bad hair day, so it was really important for me to see proper haircare and to have products that had multiple benefits,” Aniston explained.</p><p>In the past, the actress even experimented with combining various products just to come up with the right haircare ‘blend’ for herself. With LolaVie, however, that won’t be necessary anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[What] I used to always do was I would pull out a paste, I would pull out a serum, I would pull out a body oil. I would combine all of these different products that I had in order to get the results that I wanted,” Aniston explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Friends Reunion Director Found Out About Jennifer Aniston And David Schwimmer Crushing On Each Other</a></span></p><p>“So, figuring out a way to have all of those results in one bottle was really exciting and quite challenging and also having the proper ingredients and yet still perform. So, it was hard and it was a challenge, but we got it. We sort of checked all the boxes.”</p><h2 id=lolavie-rsquo-s-detangler-became-an-instant-hit>LolaVie’s Detangler Became An Instant Hit</h2><p>When LolaVie launched, the company’s first product was the Glossing Detangler, which features a vegan formula that features superfruit complex, vegetable ceramides, and lemon extract.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I love a really good detangler because my hair has gone through so much thrashing,” Aniston explained. “I love for a product to have many jobs in one, so it has a heat protector and shine, and so it's time-efficient.”</p><p>The Glossing Detangler has since received several beauty awards. Meanwhile, soon after its launch, LolaVie also introduced the Perfecting Leave-In, which repairs, hydrates, and fights off frizz, thanks to ingredients such as Rose of Jericho and bamboo extract.</p><h2 id=lolavie-launches-restorative-shampoo-and-conditioner-after-it-rsquo-s-lsquo-been-quite-requested-rsquo>LolaVie Launches Restorative Shampoo And Conditioner After It’s ‘Been Quite Requested’</h2><p>In celebration of LolaVie’s first anniversary, the company also released its Restorative Shampoo and Restorative Conditioner products, which have long been requested by many customers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Well, I think we’re going to be answering a lot of our consumers’ wishes,” Aniston said.</p><p>“The shampoo and conditioner has been quite requested over the past year, if not the most requested. When is that coming? When is that coming? So, it took the time that it took, but we got it there, and it is one of my favorite shampoos and conditioners. I might be a little bias, but what can I say?”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did 'Friends' Ruin Rom-Coms For Jennifer Aniston?</a></span></p><p>Just like its other products, the Restorative products are also vegan, featuring ingredients such as vegetable ceramides, chia seeds, and B vitamins. Moreover, in place of water, LolaVie uses bamboo essence instead while coconut-derived alternatives take the place of harmful silicones.</p><p>“It all starts in the kitchen sometimes — I would put coconut oil into my hair to smooth it out, and it would feel so lush,” Aniston explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For now, Aniston’s LolaVie products are available on the brand’s website. It’s still unclear if the actress will take her new haircare brand to retail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYremus2inZ6qXZa7qr%2FTqKVmoJGrsm6tjKGYoqqTlr%2Bmec%2Brpp2tk6l6rbXNnmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./204601-owners-late-child-actress-judith-barsis-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Judith Barsi's Home Owners Feel 'Dark Presence' in Late Child Star's House">&larr;
