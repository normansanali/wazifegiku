His career has been active since 1997.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Michael Rosenbaum is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Rosenbaum`s net worth is as high as $2 million, an amount earned through his successful career in the entertainment industry. Apart from working as an actor, Michael has tried himself as a writer and director and so far has put his name on two short films “Ghild” (2011), “Fade Into You” (2012), and one full length film “Back in the Day” (2014), which also increased his net worth.</p><h3>Michael Rosenbaum Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>Michael is the son of Julie and her ex-husband Mark Rosenbaum; his mother is a writer and also appeared in countless plays, while his father worked in the pharmaceutics industry. He has five siblings, and after his parents divorced he got two half-sisters from his father’s side. Michael grew up in Indiana, where he went to Castle High School, and after matriculation enrolled at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, graduating with a degree in theatre arts.</p><p>Michael then moved to the Big Apple in order to pursue his career as an actor; he auditioned for a role in “Talk Girl”, however, the show didn`t see the light of the day. Instead he stunned MTV intern Vincent Letizia and some of the MTV producers, who immediately showcased Michael in a reality-like show “The Temp”, in which Michael looked for a new job day after day. Little by little, Michael`s name became more and more known in the entertainment industry, and he made his debut in Clint Eastwood`s “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” (1997), starring <a href=#>John Cusack</a> and <a href=#>Kevin Spacey</a>. The same year, Michael starred in the film “The Devil & the Angel”, then in 1998 he featured in the horror thriller “Urban Legend”, directed by Jamie Blanks, while the lead role was assumed by <a href=#>Jared Leto</a>, and before the 1990s ended, Michael portrayed Jack Cooper in the TV series “Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane” (1999-2000). His net worth was established.</p><p>2001 was his breakout year, as he was selected for the role of Lex Luthor in the TV series “Smallville” (2001-2011), opposite <a href=#>Tom Welling</a> and <a href=#>Allison Mack</a>, a role which confirmed him as an actor, and increased his net worth by a large margin. In the same year, Michael appeared in the film “Sweet November”, next to <a href=#>Keanu Reeves</a> and <a href=#>Charlize Theron</a>, which also increased his net worth. During the early 2000s, Michael was quite active as a voice actor, lending his voice to characters from such animated characters as “Static Shock”, “The Zeta Project” (2001-2002), “Justice League” (2001-2006), and others, which also added to his net worth. Apart from voice roles and an on-going role in “Smallville”, Michael featured in several films, including “Sorority Boys” (2002), “Bringing Down the House” (2003) “Fudgy Wudgy Fudge Face” (2010), “Father of Invention” (2010) with Heahter Graham and <a href=#>Camilla Belle</a>, among other productions, which only increased his net worth.</p><p>After the show ended, Michael first appeared in the action drama “Catch .44” (2011), and then had a role in “Hit and Run” (2012), alongside <a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a>, <a href=#>Dax Shepard</a> and <a href=#>Kristen Bell</a>. Two years later he returned to the big screen in the film “Back in the Day”, which was also his directorial debut. In 2015, Michael was chosen for the role of Buddy Dobbs in the TV series “Impastor” (2015-2016), and he is currently working on the film “Last Days of Summer”, which is currently in post-production, but will be released before the end of 2016.<br>Thanks to his skills, Michael has received several prestigious nominations and awards, including a Saturn Award in the category Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series for his work on “Smallville”, among others.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Michael is known for his high profile relationships, as he has dated several celebrities, including <a href=#>Laura Vandervoort</a>, Candice King, and <a href=#>Danielle Harris</a>; however he is currently single.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=28.128440366972><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Michael Rosenbaum</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$352,941</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 11, 1972</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Oceanside, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.83 m)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Screenwriter, Film director, Film Producer, Voice Actor</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Western Kentucky University, John H.
